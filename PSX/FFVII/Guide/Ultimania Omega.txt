==MASSIVE SPOILERS FOR FINAL FANTASY VII AND ADVENT CHILDREN ARE IN THIS FAQ==

Also, be aware that at any point the in the translations where you see
something in brackets, it is something that I have added to the translation,
either for the purpose of clarifying the wording (Japanese does not always
translate directly into English in such a way that it's entirely coherent), or
to offer an analysis of a certain section of the translation.

Also, for your convenience, be aware that you can use the numbers to the right
of each section in the table of contents to do a ctrl+f search and instantly
get to the section of your choice.

****Statement of purpose**** (002)
This FAQ's purpose is to provide an English translation of the notable
storyline related sections of the Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Omega to the
fans of Final Fantasy VII who may be unable to acquire or translate the book
themselves. I've tried to maintain as accurate a translation here as possible,
and I believe I've managed to keep all the explanations true to the original
Japanese information offered in the book, but I'll tell you right now that
it's not going to be perfect. My teaching credentials are in the English
language and English literature, not the Japanese language. As such, I don't
claim to be a master of translating Japanese. It's just something I do as a
hobby because I enjoy it and find it interesting, and this is the first big
translation project I've done since September, 2005 when I translated Final
Fantasy VII: Advent Children. That's six months of rust to build up on my
skills, and while I do feel like I've improved even more since then, the point
I'm trying to get across is that I've done my best here, but that it's
probably still not perfect.

That said, I do have faith that I've accurately conveyed the intent of
everything present in those sections I translated, and I've tried to maintain
a Japanese-to-English wording as consistent with the original as possible.
Where that wasn't always possible (and it's never going to be), I've inserted
brackets ([ ]) to indicate the words that I had to insert in order to maintain 
the same flow we would use in English. Surprisingly, I've not had to do it all
that much.

Also, be aware that (also contained in brackets) at the end of many sections
you'll find an analysis section where I offer some kind of clarification or
comment on the section you've just read.

I do hope you'll enjoy this FAQ and that it will be of benefit to many fans of
Final Fantasy VII; both those who weren't able to read the book for themselves
and those who just want to see another take on the wording. Enjoy.





****Translations from the character profiles segment of the book**** (003)
***[Tifa's] Appearance*** (Page 23)
Her long black hair is in a hairstyle such that its tip looks like a dolphin's
tail. Her garments are simple and monotone, consisting of a tanktop and a mini
skirt, the length of which is quite short, giving a considerable degree of
exposure.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 1)
In her super-tight mini skirt, she thrives at the art of hand-to-hand
fighting.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 2)
Due to her form, her plain garments take on a pleasant appearance.

------------------------
[Analysis: This is, perhaps, the funniest thing in the entire book. It's funny
both in how it's taking the time to describe what we could see with our own
eyes, and in the wording it's using. This is not a joke. The book really says
that stuff. Anyway, it would seem that Tifa's hair ending in a shape like a
dolphin's tail was intentional, and is the reason behind the Dolphin Blow
Limit Break.]


=========================================================


***[From Aerith's bio]*** (Page 30)
|15 years ago|
Together with her mother, she escaped from the Shin-Ra headquarters to the
train station in the slums of Sector 7, where she would be seperated from her
by death. She was then brought up by Elmyra as her foster daughter. (*1)

>>>*1
After encountering her at the train station, she enters Elmyra's care and
begins living in the slums of Sector 5. Afterward, she is visited by the Turks
many times, as they request that she return to the Shin-Ra headquarters, but
she consistently refuses.

------------------------
[Analysis: Nothing notable; I was looking for an explanation of how Ifalna
was wounded during the escape from the Shin-Ra headquarters.]


=========================================================


***Stop the vehicle, please!*** (Page 37)
Yuffie fears nothing, with one exception. This [fear] is her huge weakness in
vehicles! Cargo ship, airship, submarine......no matter what she rides in, it
immediately puts her down. Especially when riding in an airship, she'll try
appealing to someone for sympathy.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
To put her motion sickness to rest a little bit, she always rides outside the
cockpit of the airship.

------------------------
[Analysis: Cute. Nothing we didn't know already, but cute.]


=========================================================


***Sephiroth's will and Jenova's will*** (Page 53)
The Sephiroth clones seen in various locations continue gathering for the
Reunion. Seemingly, the will of Jenova as a human is the result of it
consuming Sephiroth's spirit; in actuality, Sephiroth is controlling Jenova.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
Sephiroth's voice is heard through his "mother," Jenova, as applied through
its cells in the Sephiroth Clones.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section confirms that Sephiroth was in control of Jenova.]


=========================================================
***Shin-Ra Company Relations*** (Pages 56-58)
**Keyword>[The Shin-Ra Company]**
The world is actually controlled by this corporate giant. It was originally a
weapons development company called "Shin-Ra Works," but after realizing the
potential in [supplying] Mako Energy, it rapidly grew. [Through use of the
substance] Mako Energy becomes when it crystalizes -- [which is] called
"materia" -- and investing in the elite SOLDIERs, who are showered with Mako
Energy [and] sent to the battlefield, [the company] quickly brought the great
war that had spread across the globe to a conclusion; furthermore, being that
the people had become dependent on Mako Energy for their everyday lives, after
the war, the company controlled the world.

*President Shinra*
Places of appearance: Mako reactor no. 5, Shin-Ra headquarters

President of the Shin-Ra Company. Having taken it from a simple weapons
development company to a corporation that controls the world in a single
generation, he is a remarkably capable manager. He excelled at the art of
predicting human nature and guiding what the public thought. With the legends
of the Ancients' "Promised Land" [in mind], he believes that abundant mako may
lie there, and plans to monopolize it to further the company's development.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
It is his cherished theory that one can control the world by grasping the
people's hearts with money. He finds the opinion of his son, Rufus, [on how to
control the world] dangerous and ensures that it's kept away from the
company's affairs.


*Public Safety Maintenance Department*
-Heidgger-
Places of appearance: Shin-Ra headquarters and various other places

The man in charge of [Shin-Ra's] Public Safety Maintenance Division, he has a
coarse laugh of "Gahahaha" and doesn't present himself in his words or actions
as possessing much intelligence; he will speak in flattering tones to those in
higher positions, but those who are below him are the objects of his vented
annoyance and displeasure. He was a close aide of the [first] President, but
after Rufus' inauguration, he's treated coldly, and this treatment intensifies
because of [the actions] of Cloud and the others.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
His title generally held practically no value [previously], as he did nothing
but flatter the President, but Rufus saw through his incompetence.


*Weapons Development Department*
-Scarlet-
Places of appearance: Shin-Ra headquarters and various other places

The only woman on the board of directors. On the surface she is an excellent 
and beautiful weapons developer, but her speech and actions are filled with
poison. Self-centered and coldhearted, she is unconcerned at playing with the
lives of others. Her self-righteous characteristics are symbolized by her
[trademark] roar of laughter: "kyahahaha." 4 years ago, she burned Corel and
took one arm from both Barret and Dyne. In the latter half of the story [in
the game's present day], she produces the mako cannon [the Sistery Ray] and
the Proud Clod.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
She has a high degree of pride and frequently looks down upon her colleagues.
She considers Heidgger an idiot and comparable to a horse.


*Science Department*
-Hojo-
Places of appearance: Shin-Ra headquarters and various other places

Void of good sense and humanity, he is a typical mad scientist. As a novice,
he participated in the Jenova Project with Gast, an expert, but after he
[Gast] left, direction of the project fell to him [Hojo]. Gast and
collaborative research had bore the SOLDIERs, but 5 years ago, he [Hojo] began
the Sephiroth Clones experiment on his own. Company employees keep watch over
its progress and keep him informed.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
Steeped in an inferiority complex in regard to Professor Gast, he repeatedly
reacts with inhumane experiments. He's actually Sephiroth's father, but never
introduced himself [as such].


*Space Exploration Department*
-Palmer-
Places of appearance: Shin-Ra headquarters, Rocket Town

The director of Space Exploration, he is the oldest executive. Despite his
position, knowledge and dignity, he says things such as "tra, la, la" and
possesses other childlike behavior, which detracts from his character. Loving
to take his tea with sugar and lard, he's grown round, and should take a
second look at the differences of the dietary life.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
Because the Space Exploration program is currently frozen, there is little he
actually does. Though his relationship with Cid is not particularly close,
that doesn't mean he isn't talkative.


*Urban Development Department*
-Reeve-
Places of appearance: Shin-Ra headquarters

Very serious, middle-aged and [in possession of] a strong sense of
responsibility. There is a distinct line of demarcation between this man of
proper tact and the other executives. His attachment to Midgar is deep, as he
has watched over since its conceptual stages; therefore, throwing that same
city into disorder is painful for him. He is able to portray life-like
capabilities in the inanimate Cait Sith doll, which he controls by remote
from within the Shin-Ra headquarters, tracking Cloud and company's movements.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
In a meeting of the executives [during the discussion to drop the Sector 7
plate], he is straightforward in his position, frankly presenting his opinion
of the situation, but as usually happens, he gives in at the end.



**Keyword>[The Turks]**
Alias of the Shin-Ra Company's Investigation Division of the General Affairs
Department, they're actually an elite unit with a special task. It begins with
serving as bodyguards to [the company's] VIPs and scouting for members of
SOLDIER, and extends to all manner of shady activities, including espionage
and assassination. Though under the command of Heidegger, they frequently use
their own judgment.

*Rufus Shinra*
Places of appearance: The Shin-Ra headquarters and various other places

The only son of President Shinra. Cunning but cold-hearted, it's said that no
one has ever seen him bleed or cry and he has unfavorable criticism within
society. As he carried thoughts of controlling the world through fear, his
father regarded him as dangerous. After Sephiroth murdered his father, he was
given a perfect opportunity to assume position as the new president. In the
hopes of finding the Promised Land, he initiates a pursuit of Sephiroth. In
the latter half of the story, he works to conceive plans stop to Meteor and
the WEAPONs, ironically taking up the position of protecing the world from
dread.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
In a meeting of the board of [Shin-Ra's] directors, measures to counter Meteor
and the WEAPONs are put into action.


*Tseng*
Places of appearance: The Sector 7 support pillar and various other places

Leader of the Turks. Though he is still young, he has been active [as a Turk]
for more than 10 years. In the present, his subordinate, Reno, is directed to
carry out many operations, and he [Tseng] isn't given much field work. A calm,
polite person, he doesn't usually let his emotions show on the surface, and
has reservations concerning Aerith [,who he has been ordered to apprehend],
[and] for whom he has come to harbor special feelings.


*Elena*
Places of appearance: The Mythril Mines and various other places

A blemish on the Turks. After Reno was injured while carrying out orders to
drop the Sector 7 plate, she was chosen as a newcomer to the shorthanded
group. Having a loose tongue as a weakness, she carelessly discloses secret
information, and as someone who tackles every situation with complete
dedication, she has numerous complaints with her seniors' [Reno and Rude]
layed-back attitudes.


*Reno*
Places of appearance: The church in the slums and various other places

A young man with firery red hair. The condition of his uniform suggests the
attitude and personality of one who is irresponsible, but his self-confidence
and pride as a Turk is twice that of most men. In his work and in his personal
life he has his own way of doing things, adding his peculiar motto "zoto" to
the ends of sentences when speaking.


*Rude*
Places of appearance: The Shin-Ra headquarters and various other places

Reno's partner since old times. Contrasting with Reno in numerous ways, mainly
in putting work before talk, silence is the closest thing to his motto.
Despite appearances, he is not bald for fashion purposes, this being a natural
development instead. He secretly likes Tifa, even though she's an enemy.

------------------------
[Analysis: Nothing that we don't really know from playing the game except for
that small bit about Rufus' father regarding him as dangerous (though that's
touched on in Before Crisis: Final Fantasy VII), Tseng having been with the
Turks for over 10 years and the notable bit about Rude being naturally bald.]


=========================================================


***Zack*** (Page 59)
Places of appearance: Nibelheim (Cloud's flashback)

One who made for a positive-minded cheerful comrade in SOLDIER. Coming from
the remote region of Gongaga, he went to Midgar about 10 years ago. He was
recognized as having the capabilities of a 1st Class SOLDIER, but when he was
dispatched to the Mt. Nibel mako reactor, destiny would take a sudden turn.
While trying to stop Sephiroth's reckless activities, he was seriously
injured, and afterward became an experimental subject for Hojo; then, after
escaping, he was killed. At the beginning of the story, Cloud plays Zack's
role in his memories.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
Saying that they are "friends," Zack supports Cloud, his other colleague [who
was sent with Sephiroth] -- [and] who has contracted mako poisoning -- up to
the very end.


=========================================================


***Zangan*** (Page 59)
Places of appearance: Nibelheim (Cloud's flashback)

The Zangan martial arts style is an original practice, and he is Tifa's
martial arts teacher. He is always traveling, with 128 pupils in various
places. During a short stop in Nibelheim, he was giving fighting instruction
to Tifa. Shortly afterward, during the incident in which the town burned, he
went to the mako reactor to confront Sephiroth, and ended up saving Tifa,
carrying her to Midgar.


=========================================================


***Tifa's dad*** (Page 59)
Places of appearance: Nibelheim (Cloud's flashbacks)

Tifa's father. After his wife died an early death, he treated their daughter,
Tifa, with overbearing concern, [even] holding Cloud under distrust after Tifa
was in a dangerous situation. Feeling a powerful need to protect his village,
he tried to stop Sephiroth's destruction five years ago, but lost his life in
the process.


=========================================================


***Gast Faremis*** (Page 59)
Places of appearance: Icicle Lodge (video tape)

Aerith's father. He was once the head of Shin-Ra Company's Science Department.
Conducting research on the first humans, the Ancients, he believed Jenova
[whom he had discovered] was an Ancient and began "the Jenova Project" to
increase the Ancients' numbers, but during the process, he recognized his
failures and resigned. At Icicle Lodge, with the cooperation of Ifalna, he
would conduct original research that would make progress. However, shortly
after their daughter was born, he was killed by Hojo and the results of his
research were taken.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
While interviewing Ifalna about the Ancients and other matters, they began to
love one another. They then led a modest but happy life, but.......


=========================================================


***Ifalna*** (Page 59)
Places of appearance: Train station in the slums of Sector 7  (Elmyra's
flashback), Icicle Lodge (video tape)

Aerith's real mother. A woman of the Ancients living in Icicle Lodge, she was
the last Ancient of pure blood. While cooperating with Gast in his research, a
love between them began to bloom, and -- making a home with one another --
they had a daughter. However, during the peak of their happiness, it was
snatched away from them by Hojo and she and Aerith became prisoners in the
Shin-Ra headquarters, to be used for experimental purposes. Several years
later, they would escape to the train station in the slums of Sector 7, where
she would take her last breath.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
After escaping together with her daughter, Aerith -- to whom she had been able
to pass on little of the traditions and teachings of the Ancients -- she
entrusted her with the White Materia.

------------------------
[Analysis: Sadly, there's no explanation for why Ifalna died; we just have to
assume she received some kind of fatal wound during the escape.]


=========================================================


***Lucrecia*** (Page 59)
Places of appearance: Lucrecia's cave, Nibelheim (Vincent's flashback)

A woman who worked in the Shin-Ra Company's Science Department. As a member of
the Jenova Project, she served as assistant to professor Gast. She was
beautiful and intelligent, but after stepping on the road to being Hojo's
lover, she would end up offering the body of her own unborn child for
experimentation. The child who was given Jenova cells -- Sephiroth was born;
and with the effects of the experiment causing irregularities in her own body,
she removed herself from the public eye. She was the woman who was the object
of Vincent's yearning, and the reason he began to hold himself accountable of
"sin."


=========================================================


***Biggs*** (Page 60)
Places of appearance: Mako reactor no.1 and various other places

A member of AVALANCHE who gathers at the Seventh Heaven bar. Though not a very
serious person, he keeps the teachings of the Study of Planet Life firmly in
mind and takes part in anti-Shin-Ra activities. He seems to have some
complaints with Barret's leadership.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
His complaints about Barret appear in his sleep talk. Also, in the scene where
he gets drunk [while talking] to Cloud.


=========================================================


***Wedge***(Page 60)
Places of appearance: Mako reactor no.1 and various other places

Biggs' friend whom he treats like a younger brother. Plump-bodied and
humorous, he brings warmth to the base [of AVALANCHE]. Timid and kind-hearted
with everyone, he easily loses his composure. Adding "-su" to the ends of
words, he has the most polite language [of the members] in the group.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
If [the player] chooses to have Cloud speak either positively or roughly
[with Wedge, in the basement of Seventh Heaven], he [reveals] this feeling [of
cowardice/nervousness].


=========================================================


***Jessie*** (Page 60)
Places of appearance: Mako reactor no.1 and various other places

[A woman with high] inner strength and talent, she extensively mixes
explosive compounds for AVALANCHE's plans. She conducts herself in a ladylike
manner. [However, she shows herself to be more than a little clumsy.]

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
After the explosion of mako reactor no. 1, she pulls Cloud aside [to show him
the map of the Midgar Rail System].

------------------------
[Analysis: I had a little trouble translating the last line of Jessie's main
paragraph; that's why it's completely in brackets. I'm sure I missed something
in it.]


=========================================================


***Johnny*** (Page 61)
Places of appearance: Sector 7, inside a train, the Honey Bee Inn, Costa del Sol

A young man with the outward appearance of a delinquent and troubled thoughts.
Secretly harboring feelings for Tifa, he went to Seventh Heaven frequently. He
lived in the slums of Sector 7 with his parents until resolving to travel. En
route, he nearly yielded to the temptation of going to the Honey Bee Inn, but
continued traveling until he arrived at Costa del Sol, where he would begin
living with [a woman who became] his lover. Like Cloud, he has a harsh
attitude.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
At first, his mannerisms were only those of a harsh youth, but because of the
love of a woman, he would grow into a man.


=========================================================


***Bugenhagen*** (Page 63)
Places of appearance: Cosmo Canyon

The expert on the Study of Planet Life who lives in Cosmo Canyon. This elderly
man with the greeting of "Ho ho hoooo" is called "Grandfather" by Red XIII, to
whom he is close. Held in high esteem by both local people and those from
various other places, many people visit the village to be taught about the
Study of Planet Life by him firsthand. He is an unbelievable 180 years old,
but he's still full of vigor and in curiously excellent condition.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
Being a man of intelligence, he operates Shin-Ra's latest mechanized
inventions with his thoughts turned to the mysteries surrounding the voice of
the Planet.

------------------------
[Analysis: Curiously, this identifies Bugenhagen as 180 while the game
identified him as 130. Presumably, this is a typo on the part of the Ultimania
Omega, as both the English and Japanese versions of Final Fantasy VII identify
Bugenhagen as 130.]




****Translations from the Story Playback segment of the book**** (004)
***Enigma of the voice*** (Page 68)
As Cloud is trying to place the bomb, a mysterious voice speaks to him. Later,
this same kind of mysterious voice resounds in Cloud's head in the scene where
he and a voice have a conversation, and it offers him reminders. These voices
are the original Cloud, as -- due to Hojo's Sephiroth Clones experiment --
Zack's personality merged with his, creating the present day Cloud, producing
a conflict of multiple personalities(-->P.11).

During the scene in the first mako reactor, what [the voice] says is it
[trying] to point [Cloud] toward the memory of Sephiroth five years ago in
Nibelheim's mako reactor, as the two places were similar. However, Cloud is
not able to listen to the words of the memory.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
"Open your eyes!" [the voice] calls out, as it does when the scene at the
Temple of the Ancients comes and the words of Sephiroth make use of Cloud as a
puppet.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section confirms that the voice that often talks to Cloud
during the first disc of the game is his subconscious, that part of him that
was buried under the false identity he formed.]


=========================================================


***The open cell door*** (Page 94)
Indicating the brutality of Jenova, a bloodstain leads from the open cell door
-- which was opened previously without [anyone] noticing -- to the top floor.
It would seem that after awakening, Jenova intentionally opened specifically
Cloud's door, leading [him] to the top floor. As he's a person who carries
Jenova cells [inside him], was it trying to help Cloud......?

------------------------
[Analysis: This section confirms that Sephiroth -- using Jenova's main body
(see below passage entitled "Jenova inside the ship") -- opened Cloud's cell
door during the massacre in the Shin-Ra headquarters.]


=========================================================


***[From the Story Playback segment of the book]*** (Page 102)
Hojo was the cause of the malfunctions at the mako reactor. Hojo had placed
humans in the devices used to form materia, and -- being drenched in
high-density mako -- they turned into monsters.

------------------------
[Analysis: This small segment tells us that the humans who had been placed in
the pods inside the Mt. Nibel mako reactor were not only placed inside devices
used to create materia, but that they were, indeed, transformed as a result of
exposure to an unhealthy quantity of mako. This is relevant, as some fans in
the past have often wondered if, perhaps, Jenova cells were added to the mix.
This passage would seem to indicate that this was not the case, and that the
mako exposure alone was the cause of their mutations. In other words, this
section confirms that mako can cause mutations.]


=========================================================


***Jenova inside the ship*** (Page 112)
Cloud confronts "Sephiroth," the murderer of the ship's crew in the bottom of
the ship. In truth, Jenova began moving away from the Shin-Ra building on its
own, and took on the form of Sephiroth.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
This [that Jenova was being carried by Sephiroth] was a misunderstanding. The
arm was not carried, but rather was detached here.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section -- together with the accompanying screenshot where
Tifa can be seen asking if this means that Jenova was being carried -- reveals
that the main body of Jenova was not carried out of the Shin-Ra headquarters
by a Sephiroth Clone, as has often been thought in the past. In truth,
Sephiroth assumed control of the main body and had it force its way out of its
confinement, assume his form, slaughter the Shin-Ra personnel -- as well as
President Shinra himself -- open Cloud's cell door and then escape. It is this
main body of Jenova that AVALANCHE pursues from Midgar.

This section further reveals that the tentacle of Jenova that transformed into
Jenova-BIRTH on the Shin-Ra cargo ship was detached from the main body during
the confrontation with AVALANCHE in the bottom of the ship.]


=========================================================


***Tseng on the verge of death*** (Page 150)
Seeing Tseng -- who was cut down by Sephiroth and left on death's door --
Aerith is unable to hide her shock. Though they're on opposing sides, he holds
a special meaning to her.

Also, before entering the heart of the temple, if [the player] speaks to him,
he will mutter "I am...... still alive......" thereafter. When one thinks
about how the temple collapses later, doesn't his survival seem
hopeless......?

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
When faced with Tseng's condition, Aerith steps behind a pillar to try hiding
her tears.

------------------------
[Analysis: Nothing particularly special. Just tells us what we know and
presents the obvious notion that Tseng surviving that incident looked
downright impossible.]


=========================================================


***The Sephiroth of the water altar***  (Page 157)
Immediately after the tragedy surrounding Aerith takes place, the battle with
Jenova-LIFE begins, doing so such that it interrupts Sephiroth's words;
they're continued after the battle, but the title of whom they're credited to
changes from "Sephiroth" to "Jenova." The reason for this is that the
confrontation on the altar occurs with Jenova while it's displaying
Sephiroth's mimed form. It then changes to a more accurate display of its true
nature.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section reveals that the Sephiroth encountered in the City of
the Ancients (the one that murdered Aerith) was -- yet again -- Sephiroth
manipulating a part of Jenova's body in his form. Being that this form
transforms into Jenova-LIFE and gets destroyed, however, this piece was not
the main body, like that seen on the Shin-Ra cargo ship (which flew away after
leaving its "arm"/tentacle); this was a previously seperated but unidentified
part of the main body that was utilized to take Sephiroth's form.]


=========================================================


***Elena burns with vengeance*** (Page 158)
"How dare you do that to my boss!" Elena shouts, hurling her anger at Cloud.
Somehow, she suspected Cloud of being the one to try killing Tseng at the
Temple of the Ancients.

Did an encounter with Tseng provide her grief?

------------------------
[Analysis: It seems to be hinting (if I translated it right) that Elena has
seen Tseng, this being why she knows he got messed up and being why she's
upset. By the very concept, it's suggesting that he survived what happened to
him in the Temple of the Ancients. It's also notable that this original
Japanese line said by Elena did not carry the finality that her line in the
original English localization of FFVII did. There, she said "But you really
got guts doin' my boss in like that!", making it appear that Tseng had died.

Though the PC version's translation fixed this -- having Elena say that Tseng
had been messed up instead of done in -- most English-speaking and reading
players saw the version that suggested Tseng's death was a definite, leaving
many perplexed when he returned in Advent Children. Anyway, the above
translation of the line is the most literal rendering, but I think the English
PC version's take on it was well done. Sadly, there's no explanation of how
Tseng survived, though, presumably, Elena went back into the temple after
AVALANCHE had gone in and found Tseng as they had, rescuing him.]


=========================================================


***As for those which have been chased so far*** (Page 163)
Before the battle with Jenova-DEATH, the words of one of the Sephiroth Clones
in line for the Reunion offers an indication of the truth: those who carried
Jenova's cells were given the mission of bringing the Black Materia to their
master, Sephiroth. The fact of the matter is that the "Sephiroth" Cloud saw in
various places was not Sephiroth himself, but rather the body of Jenova from
the Shin-Ra building mimicing his form.

------------------------
[Analysis: This is just more of the previous confirmations: that the forms of
Sephiroth AVALANCHE has been seeing are not his real body (which has been in
the Northern Crater all this time), but Jenova's main body -- and seperated
pieces of it -- in his form. Like the piece that became Jenova-LIFE, that
which becomes Jenova-DEATH is just another unidentified piece of the main body
of Jenova, seperated from the main body and given Sephiroth's form while under
his control.]


=========================================================


***Rufus' last moment?*** (Page 197)
Taking a direct hit from Diamond WEAPON during the story, what became of him
is left a mystery. News of his death spreads to the people, but is he actually
[dead]...?

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
Heidegger and the people of Kalm conclude that [Rufus] has died.

------------------------
[Analysis: As with Tseng, we get a hint here that Rufus may have survived,
most likely to set up his return in Advent Children. Sadly, there's no
explanation of how he survived.]


=========================================================


***Vincent's anger*** (Page 198)
If Vincent is in the party when they go to the Mako Cannon's controls, during
the conversation with Hojo, Vincent will have a reaction. To Hojo, his wife
was nothing more than laboratory material to bear his son, Sephiroth, who --
as he says -- was something for him to study and satisfy his scientific
desires; [this brings on] Vincent's wrath. Additionally, after Hojo has been
killed, each party member express a line, including Vincent, who is noticably
deeply emotional.

------------------------
[Analysis: This segment confirms that Lucrecia was Hojo's wife.]


=========================================================


***Jenova-SYNTHESIS*** (Page 204)
The forms of Jenova that have been fought up to this point (BIRTH, LIFE,
DEATH) were parts of the body which escaped from the Shin-Ra building. In
regard to Jenova-SYNTHESIS, this form that was arranged to be fought inside
the Planet, it is the head of Jenova that Sephiroth had in hand five years ago
and the other parts Shin-Ra had, their Reunion complete. As such, its
appearance differs from the previous forms: the image of this form's upper
body has become strong, it being the closest to perfection.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section tells us that Jenova-SYNTHESIS is the combination of
Jenova's main body and its head. It's also implied -- since Sephiroth killed
all the Sephiroth Clones but Cloud and sent them down into the Northern Crater
-- that the cells Hojo injected into the Sephiroth Clones are part of this
merged form of Jenova.]


=========================================================


***Cloud's final battle*** (Page 204)
After fighting Bizarro Sephiroth and Safer Sephiroth, Cloud has a final 1-on-1
battle with Sephiroth in the spiritual realm. Although the ego of this
Sephiroth Clone was stricken with an inferiority complex in the past, Cloud
fights on and achieves victory in the end.

--
[Analysis: Nothing to really analyze here; it tells us what we already know
and means just what it says.]




****Complete translation of The truth of Final Fantasy VII segment**** (005)
This section touches on the difficult terminology [of the game], and in each
section explains their meaning.

***Jenova*** (Pages 210-213) (005.1)
An intelligent lifeform from somewhere in space. Approximately 2000 years ago,
it crashlanded at the North Pole ["Knowlespole" in the English localization of
the game] (the vicinity of Icicle Lodge's ["Icicle Inn" in the English
localization] present location), negatively affecting the Planet; it came to
be feared as "the Calamity from the Skies" by the Ancients, who still existed
in great numbers at that time.

Vicious, extremely aggressive and cunning. Having no thoughts of creating
anything following bringing destruction, it only follows its instincts to
incite ruin, utilizing its mimic ability (-->P.211) to infect other living
organisms with its virus. In addition, due to its abnormal resilence, even if
dismembered, its cells will call out to one another, seeking to reunite into
their original form (-->Reunion/P.211).

The scar Jenova's landing left on the Planet remains even to the present day,
being now known as "the Northern Crater."

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
The parts that are seperated from the main body are still able to function as
extensions. That is what those monsters called "Jenova" are that Cloud and
company fight during the journey.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section informs us of a few things we already knew and a few
we may not have. Jenova came from an unidentified point in space, and --
though quite intelligent and cunning -- is nothing more than an instinctual
monster made up of viral cells, which it seeks to spread to other lifeforms.
This instinct to infect other lifeforms -- and its desire to rejoin when its
cells get seperated -- are the only things this creature lives to do.

This section also further confirms that the Jenova-BIRTH, LIFE, and DEATH
bosses are merely seperated parts of Jenova's main body.]
------------------------



**Jenova Relation 1: The Jenova Project** (005.1A)
Approximately 30 years ago, a plan to find "the Promised Land of abundant
mako" is set in motion by way of the Shin-Ra Science Department beginning a
project under Gast's direction. The purpose of the project was to
artificially produce someone with the abilities of the Ancients
(Cetra/-->P.214). Jenova, discovered in the Northern Crater, was incorrectly
identified as an Ancient, and its cells were to be injected into a normal
human with the expectation that they may artificially display the abilities of
the Cetra as a result.

Research was conducted at the Shinra Mansion in Nibelheim. It began under the
responsibility of three members [of Shin-Ra's Science Department]: Gast, Hojo
and Lucrecia; but Gast withdraws midway [through the project]. Authority over
the project is then transferred to Hojo. "The Sephiroth Clones Project"
(-->P.213) follows as an extension of this.


*Professor Gast and the Jenova Project*
Approximately 2000 years ago, Jenova collided with the Planet, and although
the Ancients were nearly reduced to extinction, some Ancient survivors
managed to seal Jenova underground in a deep sleep. However, Jenova would
awaken because of Gast's guidance of Shin-Ra's Science Department.

Approximately 30 years ago, the mummified form of Jenova was excavated and
Jenova mistakenly identified as an Ancient; the Jenova Project then began.
Hojo was a member of the project; the body of his colleague and lover,
Lucrecia, was utilized for experimental purposes, injected with Jenova cells
prior to her giving birth. Thus, Sephiroth was born.

After several years, Gast became wracked with guilt, and -- in regret of the
use of humans for such an abnormal experiement -- gave Shin-Ra his
resignation. He then removed himself to Icicle Lodge, which lay in the
vicinity of where he had discovered Jenova, and began new independent
research. There, he would make the acquintance of a local woman with the
name of "Ifalna," a survivor of the Ancients; interviewing her, he would begin
to arrive at the truth about the history of the Ancients, Jenova's mimic
ability and the WEAPONs  (-->P.215), things which Shin-Ra knew nothing about.
In the meantime, a love between he and Ifalna would form, and together they
would make a home and have a child: Aerith. However, he would be shot under
Hojo's orders and the results of Gast's research fell into Hojo's hands.


*The product of the project: Sephiroth*
While in Lucrecia's womb, Jenova's cells became part of Sephiroth's growth.
While he's the biological son of Hojo and Lucrecia, with regards to his role
in the project as an unnatural product of "Jenova of the Ancients," one could
say that he is "the son of Jenova." Simultaneously, he was the first to have
the role of a SOLDIER (-->P.217). However, mass production of SOLDIERs
required adults of sound mind and body who could be injected with Jenova's
cells and exposed to mako, as this simplification of the process used on
Sephiroth would result in vast differences from how their bodies had been
before.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
The staff of Shin-Ra -- who did not know the true nature of Jenova -- believed
Sephiroth to be an Ancient.


*Jenova's mimic ability*
Jenova has a mimic ability which allows it to read the memories and feelings
of others, then adjust its appearance, speech and behaviour accordingly to
immitate what it has seen. Jenova once used this ability to get close to the
Ancients and infect them with its virus, which killed many of them.

This ability is not limited solely to Jenova itself, for those who have its
cells within them possess it as well, though in an incomplete form.
Immediately prior to the start of the game, when Cloud's mind was shattered,
he ran into Tifa and seemed to immediately return to "normal" (-->P.13); this
was because the mimic abilities of the Jenova cells inside Cloud read her
mind, seeing her memories of him, which were then combined with his own ideal
vision of himself, fashioning a new personality for him.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 1)
According to Ifalna, the Ancients infected with the virus lost their sanity
and turned into monsters.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 2)
As Sephiroth said in the Whirlwind Maze, when Cloud met Tifa, he formed a new
personality.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section tells us that while Sephiroth was lying about much of
what he told Cloud, he was telling the truth when he said that Cloud formed a
new personality when he met Tifa shortly before the main events of Final
Fantasy VII began. Sephiroth's story was filled with half-truths: Cloud was,
indeed, a Sephiroth Clone, he did form a new personality when meeting Tifa
(thanks to the abilities of Jenova's cells) and he was not the 1st Class
SOLDIER who had gone to Nibelheim with Sephiroth; however, he was a real
person (being a Sephiroth Clone only meant that he had been injected with
Jenova cells and infused with mako like members of SOLDIER) and really had
been in Nibelheim.]
------------------------



**Jenova Relation 2: The Reunion* (005.1B)
Due to its amazing regeneration capabilities, Jenova's divided cells reunite
to become one again.

5 years ago, Sephiroth fell into the Lifestream holding the head of Jenova,
going to the Northern Crater, where the Planet's energy is concentrated, and
where he would begin the Reunion -- and assuring his restoration -- by
focusing through Jenova's cells. This regeneration was to be carried out by
way of the Reunion, as the scattered Sephiroth Clones (-->P.213) would begin
migrating toward the Northern Crater.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 1)
The Reunion is an ability of Jenova, but Sephiroth instructs the Sephiroth
Clones in the role of their master.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 2)
The main body of Jenova began migrating from the Shin-Ra headquarters because
of the Reunion. The Jenova cells in Cloud received the call of the Reunion the
same as those of the mimiced form.


*The movement of Jenova's main body for the Reunion*
Excavated 30 years ago, Jenova became the experimental material for the Jenova
Project and was placed in the Mt. Nibel mako reactor.

Jenova remained in the Mt. Nibel reactor until five years before the game,
when Sephiroth -- having learned the secret of his birth -- took off its head,
which fell with him into the bottom of the reactor. The now headless main body
that was left in the reactor was -- by Hojo's instruction and after being
utilized in the Sephiroth Clones experiment -- transported to the Shin-Ra
building.

Shortly after Cloud was apprehended when he broke into the Shin-Ra building to
rescue Aerith, the Reunion began. Hojo expected the headless main body to be
the focal point for the Reunion once it began, but in reality, it was the
Northern Crater. The scattered Sephiroth Clones and the main body of Jenova
within the Shin-Ra building all began to move. Jenova shattered its
containment case, murdered President Shinra, escaped from the Shin-Ra
building and began to wander the world. Now, Jenova's mimic abilities caused
the main body to take on Sephiroth's voice and appearance, which it kept
hereafter during its appearances in various places.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 1)
The head of Jenova from the Mt. Nibel mako reactor -- which fell into the
hands of Sephiroth -- had an influence on the focal point of the Reunion.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 2)
The shape of Sephiroth was assumed by Jenova's main body. It is in this form
that it is seen committing murders.


*The path of Jenova's main body, which came from the Shin-Ra building*
In the Story Playback section (-->P.66), the conduct of the mimetic main body
of Jenova  [having taken Sephiroth's form] and that of the Sephiroth Clones
were listed in the "Black sheep information" columns. Here, those specifically
regarding the main body of Jenova have been collected.

**Jenova Relation 3: The Sephiroth Clones** (005.1C)
5 years ago, immediately after Sephiroth fell into the Mt. Nibel mako reactor,
Jenova's main body -- which had been left behind -- was utilized by Hojo for
an experiment. This plan -- which Hojo intended to use to prove his Jenova
Reunion Theory -- was called "the Sephiroth Clones Project."

The experiment's procedure -- which involved injecting cells taken from the
headless body of Jenova into the subjects and exposing them to mako -- doesn't
differ from the manufacturing procedure for SOLDIERs. The largest difference
is that SOLDIERs are selected from a prime field, being strong of mind and
body and able to withstand the experiment uninfluenced by Jenova's cells,
whereas the Clones' fragile minds leave them as "portions" of Jenova. The
subjects of the Sephiroth Clones Project were the survivors of the Nibelheim
incident, with absolutely no thought given to sorting them as with SOLDIER,
and -- being unable to maintain their egos -- they lose the ability to live a
normal human life.

With the Sephiroth Clones, as part of the experiment, an identification number
was engraved somewhere into their bodies. Cloud was a Sephiroth Clone, but
received no number due to the "failure work" (referenced  in the article
below). Cloud's obsessive drive to chase Sephiroth and settle everything over
the thoughts of him taking his hometown -- at any cost to and an indifference
for himself -- is much the same as that of the Jenova cells.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
After Sephiroth reduced Nibelheim to ashes, it was reconstructed and the
movements of the Sephiroth Clones observed, though with little concern for
their well-being.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section pretty much tells us things we know from the game: the
procedure used on Cloud and the other survivors of Nibelheim to make them into
"Sephiroth Clones" was identical to the procedure used on members of SOLDIER,
the difference being that members of SOLDIER are specially selected because
they have the physical AND mental strength to handle exposure to mako and
being injected with Jenova's cells. Of course, the purpose of the experiment
also differed, in that instead of being intended to be members of SOLDIER,
these guys were just intended to prove the Jenova Reunion Theory, and if they
died after that, Hojo really didn't care.

This section also brings up the matter of the failure of the project, who --
despite popular misinterpretation -- was not Cloud, but was Zack; he didn't
suffer the ill effects of the experiment, which allowed him to break himself
and Cloud out of the Shinra Mansion before Cloud be given a number. Of course,
there's more on that to come in the next section, so I'll stop here.]
------------------------


*Successful work, failure work*
As for the mentally and physically strong, carrying Jenova's cells inside
their bodies will not cause them to receive Jenova's influence, and they will
not become a puppet of Jenova like the Sephiroth Clones, but will instead
become a SOLDIER possessing strength far beyond that of a normal human being.

In Zack's case, he had already successfully received the SOLDIER procedure
previously, and undergoing experimentation as a Sephiroth Clone did not make
him into a puppet of Jenova; he retained his normal human behavior to the
end. However, unlike Zack, the residents of Nibelheim were perfect in the role
of Sephiroth Clones for Hojo's experiment. As for Cloud, like the other
residents of Nibelheim -- [who all became perfect] Sephiroth Clones -- being
unable to withstand the SOLDIER treatments, he could not retain himself and
his mind completely collapsed. When reunited with Tifa in Midgar, though, the
coherence of being normal would return to him and he would gain a personality
that essentially let him be his own person, even if confusion would come of
it.

Also noteworthy is Sephiroth's unique case. Until the secret of his birth was
known, he had legendary strength of which he was proud, but 5 years ago, he
began walking a different road from that of humans. However, he was unwilling
to be placed under Jenova's control and became the leader himself, with its
actions falling under his control in the end. This fact resulted in Sephiroth
gaining a new sense of strength.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
Even without awareness of the Reunion as a Sephiroth Clone, Cloud was still
drawn to it like the other Clones.

------------------------
[Analysis: As mentioned in the previous analysis section, Cloud was a
successful Sephiroth Clone, having the exact results Hojo had hoped for; he
wasn't the failure at all, and instead, Zack -- who freed Cloud before he
could get a number -- was. Zack could handle the SOLDIER/Sephiroth Clone
treatments just fine, and this made him a failure for the purposes of Hojo's
experiment.

This section also reiterates the notable fact that Sephiroth's will and
ambitions were too powerful for him to be controlled by Jenova, and that he
became its ruler instead.]
------------------------


*The Sephiroth Clones that make appearances in various places*
The following are the Sephiroth Clones seen branded with numbers, [as well as]
one who was [once inaccurately] concluded to be like them.

1......The one with a tattoo seen in the palm of his hand. He went from North
Corel to the Gold Saucer.

2......The man being watched over in Sector 5 [of Midgar]; he was suffering
from the effects of mako poisoning.

4......One of the wriggling black mantled people in Nibelheim.

5......One of the wriggling black mantled people in Nibelheim.

9......Exited from the entrance of the Temple of the Ancients. [This Sephiroth
Clone's] tattoo was on their neck.

11.....One of the wriggling black mantled people in Nibelheim.

12.....One of the wriggling black mantled people in Nibelheim.

13.....(Red XIII)

------------------------
[Analysis: While Red XIII is on this list, his placement is implied to be only
a result of him having a tattoo and of him having once believed that he might
have been like the Sephiroth Clones, as he had no idea what Hojo had done to
him. No one but Hojo and Sephiroth knew the true nature of the Sephiroth
Clones at that time, so there was some uncertainty concerning whether or not
Red XIII was supposed to be like them. Of course, it's later revealed that the
Sephiroth Clones were all survivors from the Nibelheim incident of five years
before, and in light of that, as well as the fact that Red XIII was
apprehended by Shin-Ra less than two years earlier (as seen in Before Crisis:
Final Fantasy VII) and the fact that Hojo wouldn't have wanted Red XIII to be
killed -- made evident by the fact that he said he wanted to preserve his
species back in the Shin-Ra headquarters -- it becomes apparent that Red XIII
was not a Sephiroth Clone at all.]
------------------------




***The Ancients*** (Page 214) (005.2)
The race also called "the Cetra," these people lived on the Planet in ancient
times. The Forgotten Capital and the Temple of the Ancients along with nature
and a single woman are their only remaining traces.

They spoke with the Planet and helped to cultivate it, channeling the
Lifestream to many places, inciting an abundant cycle of life. When Jenova
came from outer space, some of them moved to the North Pole in an attempt to
ease the Planet's wound which had come as a result of the collision [between
the Planet and the meteor Jenova had been riding]. Using its mimic ability,
Jenova got close to the Cetra and released its virus upon them, nearly
driving them to extinction.

Only two Ancients appear in the [game's] story: Aerith and Ifalna. Ifalna is
Aerith's mother and the last pure ancient. Due to her mixed heritage, Aerith's
ability to converse with the Planet is comparitively lower than her mother's
was.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
As seen in situations with Aerith, the Ancients had a special ability to
speak with the Planet. They called it a "Planet reading."

------------------------
[Analysis: This section indicates that while normal humans can gain some of
the Cetra's abilities despite their lost heritage -- such as hearing the
Planet's cries (AVALANCHE and Bugenhagen) and even the ability to understand
it (Bugenhagen) -- genetics can play a role in the matter, as well. Due to
all humans on the Planet (Cetra and the normal humans) being descended from
the Cetra of the past, and because some ordinary humans gained some abilities
reminiscent of the Cetra (AVALANCHE and Bugenhagen gained the ability to hear
the Planet's cries, and Bugenhagen even interpreted words in the air at the
Forgotten Capital), it can be concluded that being a Cetra is a lifestyle or
culture, but that those who are directly descended from "practicing Cetra"
are more easily attuned to the abilities of the Cetra.

In other words, whereas normal humans have to actively pursue the rekindling
of their lost heritage, a child of one with Cetra abilities will likely be
experiencing those abilities whether they want to or not (as Aerith did). In
other words, being a Cetra is apparently both genetic and cultural.]
------------------------



**The Ancients Relation 1: The Promised Land** (005.2A)
The aim of the Cetra was to find the land where supreme happiness awaited.
Passed down as an oral tradition, what the land of supreme happiness is
supposed to be was never concretely identified.

The Shin-Ra interpreted that a land of supreme happiness must be somewhere
where they could find abundant mako [as it would make them even more wealthy],
and wished to use an Ancient to help them find it, while Sephiroth considered
the Promised Land to be a place in which he could draw the power to use the
Black Materia in his aim to become a "god." Though both of them had different
goals, they both got the idea that the Northern Crater was the place they were
looking for.

The theory of one of the Planet Life scholars [in Cosmo Canyon] is that the
Cetra's mission to find the land of supreme happiness is equivalent to the
peaceful sleep [of dying and returning to the Planet] (a line delivered [in
the game]). According to this theory, the Lifestream -- to which everyone
returns -- is itself the Promised Land, but this is not something that one can
assert to be true for everyone. Therefore, it is in each person's hands to
take their own interpretation.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
For one with the conception that the Promised Land is a place where energy
swells up from inside the sleeping earth, the Northern Crater -- where the
Lifestream breathes forth -- may be it.

------------------------
[Analysis: Here, we're pretty much told that there's no correct take on what
the Promised Land is, and that it could be any number of different things for
any number of different people. It can even be the same thing that another
person would consider the Promised Land, but for entirely different reasons.
Sephiroth and Shin-Ra both considered the Northern Crater to be the Promised
Land; Sephiroth because he knew he could use the energy there to help him
use the Black Materia in his plans to become a "god," and Shin-Ra because they
saw it as a land where "the abundant Mako will just come out on its own,"
allowing them to bypass the costly maintenance of mako reactors and just
reap profits.

The basic conclusion is that there is no conclusion: the Promised Land is not
one thing, and is something specific to each individual. This idea is brought
up again in the "Maiden who Travels the Planet" novella at the back of the
Ultimania Omega, in which Aerith refers to the Lifestream as the Cetra's
Promised Land, while the Northern Crater is referred to as Sephiroth's
Promised Land.]
------------------------




***Meteor and Holy*** (Pages 214-215) (005.3)
**The Black Materia: Meteor** (005.3A)
It is the Ultimate Destructive Magic; it calls to planets [-- meaning
meteor-like rocks --] drifting in outer space and pulls them down to the
Planet. It was one of the magicks given to the Ancients, but due to it
harnessing enough power to destroy the Planet itself, the Ancients feared it
could prove dangerous and sealed it away by their own hands.

After falling into the Lifestream, Sephiroth learned of Meteor from the
Cetra's firsthand knowledge of it, and set into motion a plan to gain mastery
over the life of the Planet.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
When the Planet is hurt, the spiritual energy that is the Planet's very life
will automatically gather in that spot. Sephiroth planned to make use of this
by intentionally harming the Planet and gaining dominance over its energy.



**The White Materia: Holy** (005.3B)
The only means of opposing Meteor, the Ultimate White Magic was passed down
amongst the Ancients. It is said that when an Ancient learns of Holy in the
Forgotten Capital, prays at the water altar and their mind then links to the
Planet, Holy is thereby put into operation. Passed down through the Ancients'
generations, the White Materia came to Aerith from her mother, Ifalna, and she
kept it hidden in a ribbon in her hair.

How exactly Holy applies its power once invoked and in operation is not
definite. It is simply known that "all that is bad for the Planet will
disappear."

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
As evidence of the Planet accepting Aerith's prayer, the White Materia laying
on the water bed shines a pale green color. However, Holy's movement was being
held back by the wicked will of Sephiroth, who had called Meteor.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section confirms what many who played the game believed: that
Aerith knew nothing of Holy until she got to the City of the Ancients -- to
which she felt herself being drawn -- and learned of it there, the same way
that Bugenhagen later would.]
------------------------




***The WEAPONs*** (Page 215) (005.4)
The WEAPONs, created by the Planet itself, exist for the sake of acting as a
self-defense mechanism [for the Planet]. Once, when the Planet had been
injured after Jenova collided with it, Jenova became an impediment [to the
Planet healing], and the Planet manufactured the WEAPONs to remove the
creature by force.

However, because the survivors of the Cetra succeeded in sealing Jenova away,
the Planet mixed the WEAPONs with the natural mako within the Northern Crater
and put them to sleep for a long time; until they -- perceiving the crisis to
the Planet -- awakened simultaneously with Sephiroth calling Meteor. Regarding
everything as a threat to the Planet, humans and civilizations became targets
of the WEAPONs' destruction, though they faced opposition in Cloud and his
friends.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
Within the Northern Crater, where the Lifestream swells, the WEAPONs were put
to sleep. Their faces are visible within the enormous mako which formed within
the crater.

------------------------
[Analysis: According to this section, the WEAPONs began attacking everything
because they perceived everything as a threat to the Planet. Many fans have
pondered why they didn't go after Sephiroth, as he was the one holding Holy
back and preventing it from stopping Meteor; the Maiden who Travels the Planet
novella at the back of the book explains that Sephiroth's barrier around the
Northern Crater prevented the WEAPONs from detecting him. As a result, they
attacked everything else instead. What's not clear, however, is if this means
that they would have focused on Sephiroth if they could sense him, or if he
simply wanted to prevent them from attacking him, as they eventually would
have.

Also, it's long been believed by many fans that the WEAPONs may have been
trying to kill everything in order to strengthen the Lifestream with
additional spiritual energy, and while this section seems to suggest
that they simply attack anything that they could perceive as a threat to the
Planet, the fact that prior to their awakening Hojo stated that the WEAPONs'
purpose was to destroy everything -- which he had learned from Gast's
interviews with Ifalna -- would suggest that the two ideas may not be mutually
exclusive. The Planet would benefit from both, and both would be accomplished
in the same way.

Finally, be aware that there are two more WEAPONs not identified here, though
one of them does appear in the original Final Fantasy VII, while both appear
in Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII. One of them is Chaos, Vincent's
ultimate Limit Break, and the other is Omega WEAPON.]
------------------------



**The WEAPONs that appear in the story** (005.4A)
Diamond WEAPON/Diamo WEAPON
The WEAPON from the earth that shines white. Outside Midgar, this WEAPON from
the earth sparkles. During its invasion of Midgar, both it and the Northern
Crater's barrier were hit by a beam from the Mako Cannon. In the International
version [of the game], it fights Cloud and company, but the developments that
follow are the same.

Ruby WEAPON
The WEAPON of deep crimson that lies hidden in the desert sands. A formidable
opponent, like the Emerald WEAPON also included in the International version,
it was arranged to be fought most effectively 1-on-1.

Emerald WEAPON
The green WEAPON that travels hidden in the deep sea. Appearing only in the
International version, it is also possible to fight it, but without a special
Materia, it is inevitably going to be a bitter fight.

Ultimate WEAPON/Ultima WEAPON
The winged, jet-black WEAPON that owns the skies. It fights Cid and company in
Mideel, but has been arranged to be fought many times.

Sapphire WEAPON
The navy blue WEAPON that swims through the ocean, it is not possible to
actually fight it. When Tifa and Barret are in Shin-Ra's Junon offices, it
draws near, but is defeated and sunk by the Mako Cannon.

------------------------
[Analysis: There's not a lot said here that's really notable, but it is worth
mentioning that "Diamond WEAPON" and "Ultimate WEAPON" were called "Diamo
WEAPON" and "Ultima WEAPON" in the Japanese versions of the game. Apparently,
when the game was localized into English, the names were expanded to match the
words they were based on. It's interesting to note that in subsequent 
localizations of Final Fantasy games, the "Ultima" in "Ultima Weapon" was kept
as such for the creatures that would bear that name.]
------------------------




***Lifestream*** (Pages 216-217) (005.5)
Everything that lives on the Planet returns to the Planet, and new life is
born from their life force, which is also the life of the Planet and is called
"Spirit Energy." The flowing collective of this spiritual energy is called
"the Lifestream."

When those who live on the Planet die, their life force returns to the Planet,
becomes part of the Lifestream and is eventually allocated into a new life
that will grow. This cycle of energy normally allows the Planet to function
richly.



**Lifestream Relation 1: Mako Energy** (005.5A)
The name the Shin-Ra have given to spiritual energy. This nickname is "Mako
Energy." In the Study of Planet Life's philosophy, it is called "Spirit
Energy," but it is called "mako" by others in its use in humans' daily
lives. Both labels are used, but the title of "Spirit Energy" is opposed in
modern times, as the use of mako in peoples' daily lives rapidly spreads.


*Mako poisoning*
The Lifestream is the place to which all life returns, and, as a result, it is
overflowing with knowledge. Consequently, when one falls in the Lifestream,
the surge of information entering their head exceeds their brain's tolerance
level and the danger of their mind shattering becomes high. The state in which
one's mind has collapsed like this is called "mako poisoning," and doesn't
happen only by falling into the Lifestream, but also through being exposed to
mako. Cloud has suffered from this condition on 2 occasions.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section is basically saying that the knowledge of those who
die returns to the Lifestream with their spirits, and there it combines with
all the other knowledge; so the Lifestream is a big sea of spirit energy
filled with knowledge and memories, and when someone else falls into that sea
-- or is exposed to it through mako infusion -- that knowledge fills their
brains. If they're not capable of handling all that extra knowledge that
doesn't belong to them, it can cause their mind to "break," resulting in them
going into a vegetative state (mako poisoning). Members of SOLDIER like Zack
can handle this without losing their own place among all the extra knowledge,
but people with inferiority complexes (most people, including Cloud) can't.]
------------------------


*The various mako reactors*
Shin-Ra's prices for providing Mako Energy from their mako reactors have
increased in the various places around the world where mako is abundant. Those
that appear in the [game's] story are the 8 mako reactors around Midgar, the
Mt. Nibel reactor, the Corel reactor, the Gongaga reactor, the undersea
reactor and the Fort Condor reactor. Recently, before the beginning of the
game, the Gongaga reactor suffered a meltdown and activities there have been
suspended; during the story, Midgar's reactor numbers 1 and 5 are blown up at
the hands of Cloud.


*Materia and postwar society*
When Mako Energy condenses, it becomes materia. In places where the energy is
abundant, materia has formed naturally, but these are rare instances and it's
more practical for Shin-Ra to manufacture it by way of artificial production.

It is said that the knowledge of the Ancients is within materia. By bringing
out this knowledge [through contact with the materia], one can interact with
the Planet and even an ordinary person can gain the powers of the Ancients, as
it is the condensed [spiritual energy which contains their] knowledge that is
implemented as a link [to the Planet]......This allows for the presentation of
abilities [associated with the materia].

Materia is mostly used for combat purposes, as they hold power that far
exceeds that of traditional weaponry. As a weapons development company, the
Shin-Ra commercialized materia as a battlefield investment, having previously
invested in a line of SOLDIERs, and quickly brought a transcontinental war
that had lasted for several years to a close. Monopolozing the production of
materia, Shin-Ra quickly began to take the lead in postwar society. Although
peace then began to settle across the world, the Shin-Ra were establishing a
desptoic order, as the people became increasingly dependent on mako, which has
brought us to the present day.



**Lifestream Relation 2: The Study of Planet Life** (005.5B)
The study of the Planet, which the scholars in Cosmo Canyon reared. In Cosmo
Canyon, the voice of the Planet can be heard, and there it is treated with
great care, regarded as a living entity, a way of thought -- stemming from
ancient roots -- that has been systematically organized. Red XIII's tribe and
Bugenhagen's tribe -- called "the Bugah Tribe" -- follow the ideology of the
Study of Planet Life, giving great consideration to the life of the Planet and
making advanced progress in researching the subject. In addition, the Bugah
Tribe also conducts research on the Ancients.

The Lifestream, Spirit Energy, and the circle of life are all aspects of the
Study of Planet Life. The anti-Shin-Ra group AVALANCHE was founded by one who
had been strongly influenced by the Study of Planet Life.

------------------------
[Analysis: This section tells us that Bugenhagen's tribe has a name ("the
Bugah Tribe"), but sadly leaves us with no name for Red XIII's tribe. Despite
popular misinterpretation, Bugenhagen is not Red XIII's biological
grandfather; this is simply a title of familiarity.]
------------------------


*The Planet's circle of life*
1) A person grows......Their knowledge increases

2) Return to the Planet (the Planet's growth)......When a soul returns to the
Planet, the Planet grows

3) The Planet produces new life......The next generation is born (the Planet
now bears the evolved energy gained from the previous generation of life it
produced)

Sephiroth['s plan to have] Meteor fall would result in (1) a vast increase in
the level of death, and (2) the disembodied energy would also gather at the
Planet's wound, allowing him to make use of the energy's return to the Planet.

The (2) course of the Planet's energy [when returning to the Lifestream] is
interrupted by Shin-Ra's method of forcibly extracting it and consuming it
(3).

------------------------
[Analysis: This section informs us with clarity that the concept of the Gaia
Theory seen in Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within is identical to the
Lifestream idea presented in Final Fantasy VII: energy is distributed by the
Planet, giving life to various lifeforms which then grow and gain knowledge
and memories as they do so; when they die, this energy then returns to the
Planet, taking the knowledge/memories with it, allowing the Planet as a whole
to grow.]
------------------------


*The anti-Shin-Ra organization*
One who participated in the Study of Planet Life began to question the conduct
of Shin-Ra due to their use of the Planet's Spirit Energy as mako. To protect
the life of the Planet, they began anti-Shin-Ra activites in various places.
Extreme conduct would follow on their part, and the explanation of Shin-Ra's
faults that they offered held that the life of the Planet was more valuable
than that of humans.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 1)
The anti-Shin-Ra organization AVALANCHE -- whose activites were aimed to
disrupt Midgar -- had the power to serve as an obstacle to Shin-Ra.

(Accompanying screenshot caption 2)
The AVALANCHE seen in the game was the new AVALANCHE, of which Barret was the
leader. Their base was the Seventh Heaven bar in the slums of Sector 7.

------------------------
[Analysis: Here, we're basically told what we already knew from the game: that
someone who participated in the Study of Planet Life in Cosmo Canyon founded
AVALANCHE. Barret mentions that AVALANCHE was founded in Cosmo Canyon during
the party's stop there, but what wasn't made explicitly clear to many players
of the English localization, however, is that Barret was not the founder of
AVALANCHE and was not its original leader.

In fact, Barret was not even a member of the original AVALANCHE. In Before
Crisis: Final Fantasy VII, events dating back six years feature the first
public appearance of AVALANCHE, with their leadership consisting of three
people: Shears, a field commander, Fuhito, a research commander who had more
authority than Shears, and Elfe, a young woman who supposedly served as the
group's overall leader. In truth, Fuhito was using her and was the one who had
obssessively dedicated himself to the Planet after researching the Study of
Planet Life; he had a complete disregard for the lives of human beings, and --
being utterly dedicated to the Planet -- wished to use a powerful summon
called "Zirconiade" to eradicate all living things on the surface of the
Planet so that it could have back all of its Spirit Energy, while
simultaneously being free of all native threats.]
------------------------



***Lifestream Relation 3: SOLDIER*** (005.5C)
Shin-Ra's elite soldiers. The Turks scout to gather those who would be capable
of handling being injected with Jenova's cells and exposed to mako; those who
are gain a massive artificial increase in strength and ability. It is not
common to impose this procedure on one against their will, as the resulting
changes to their mind and body can be large, and they must be able to bear the
experiment's process in order to become a SOLDIER.

Those who are selected to become these elite soldiers will join SOLDIER in
either 1st, 2nd, or 3rd Class, as based on their capabilities. The superior
class is 1st Class, but those who reach this rank are few in number. Each
class has its own respective uniform, but only those who are 1st Class are
allowed to also wear civilian clothes.

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
Sephiroth bloomed on the battlefield and many boys yearned to join SOLDIER.
Sephiroth was instrumental in Cloud and Zack having their eyes on joining
SOLDIER.





****Translations of the vehicle specifications**** (006) (Pages 301-313)
In this section, I'll be offering my translations of the various vehicle
specs offered by the Ultimania Omega in its World of FFVII section. I've done
my best to translate this information accurately, but I'm not an expert on the
various mechanics of vehicles, so if you are and you see anything that doesn't
seem to make sense, then that might be why.

Also, if you notice that the romanizations for the vehicle names don't match
those used in the original game -- or in other places -- with respect to
punctuation or capitalization, be aware that I copied the romanizations used
by the Ultimania Omega as they appear in the book itself. With all that out of

****Translations concerning the plot-related connection between FFVII and
FFX/X-2**** (007)
As some fans of Final Fantasy VII, X and X-2 may or may not know, the worlds
of the two games share a plot-related connection. The connection's existance
was established during an interview with Yoshinori Kitase (lead developer of
the Final Fantasy series) and Kazushige Nojima (the scenario writer of Final
Fantasy VII, Before Crisis, Advent Children, Final Fantasy VIII, Final Fantasy
X, Final Fantasy X-2 and the Kingdom Hearts series) in 2002, as featured in
the Final Fantasy X Ultimania Omega guidebook, an official Square-Enix
publication.

This interview established that there would be a connection between the two
worlds, though it didn't detail it. However, based on what was later revealed
to be the connection, it's clear that it had already been conceived, as
Kitase hints at it with his final word on the subject. In 2003, the exact
nature of the concept was finally revealed in the Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania,
having been hinted toward by a few elements of the game.

Nojima revealed that Shinra of the Gullwings, an Al Bhed child prodigy and
inventor of various machinery, would attempt using the remains of Vegnagun --
the behemoth machina Shuyin tried to destroy Spira with -- to extract life
energy from the Farplane and use it to power machines. Shinra would attempt
doing this as a result of his analysis of the Farplane late in the game.
During this diagnostic, Shinra concluded that there was a great deal of energy
floating around inside the Farplane, and that it was most likely the life
force of Spira, which could be extracted and used as a power source; however,
he concluded that it would take generations to properly implement the idea.

Further of note is that Nojima explained that the Al Bhed entrepeneur Rin also
was interested in extracting mako from the Farplane, and that he provided
Shinra with the funding to make the attempt. For his part, Rin's desire to do
this is revealed during the game should he be uncovered as the culprit behind
covering up the malfunctioning machina disaster on the Mi'hen Highroad.

Nojima went on to say that Shinra's attempts to use Vegnagun's remains failed
and that he was unable to complete the concept of mako-extraction, just as
Shinra had predicted. However, some 1000 years later, once space travel became
possible, Shinra's descendants would go on a voyage to the world of Final
Fantasy VII. There, at some point in the future, they would be successful in
utilizing the concept, and would provide electricity from the Planet for a
price; these descendants would found the Shin-Ra Company of Final Fantasy VII.

The connection would again be hinted toward in the Final Fantasy X-2:
International+Last Mission (released in 2004) game's Last Mission scenario, in
which Rikku revealed that Rin and Shinra had begun working together. Next,
the Final Fantasy VII Ultimania Omega guidebook (released in September, 2005)
also brings forth mention of the concept, and, finally, the connection may
have received further indication through Dirge of Cerberus (released in
January, 2006) and the Advent Children Reunion Files book (released in May,
2006), in which it is established that the Shera airship seen in Advent
Children and Dirge of Cerberus runs on ancient, lost non-mako technology that
Cid discovered. This technology very well may have originally belonged to
Shinra's descendants, as they are the only previous inhabitants of VII's world
indicated to have been in possession of advanced technology, and because the
interior of the Shera bears some aesthetic resemblances to those of the
Fahrenheit and Celsius airships that figure prominently into FFX and FFX-2
(though the Shera's interior bears more of a resemblance to the Celsius').

I will here present the dialogue from Final Fantasy X-2 that hints at the
connection, as well as the interviews and other translations that establish
its existance as part of official Final Fantasy continuity.

***Dialogue with Rin from Final Fantasy X-2***
Rin
"You are suggesting that my decision to upgrade the machina resulted in a
number of casualties... ... and that I tried to cover it up?"

Yuna
"You put the investigation in our hands because we were amateurs. You hoped we
would botch the case."

Yuna
"And then, I kept calling you even though I didn't have any leads."

Yuna
"You would have objected to the meaningless interruptions, if you really
wanted to solve the case."

Rin
"I see. It appears that I have underestimated you, Yuna."

Rikku
"Why, Rin?"

Rin
"If word got out that machina pose a danger, people would fear them and stop
using them."

Paine
"So Yevon's not alone in sweeping things under the rug."

Rin
"I firmly believe that machina are an indispensable part of Spira's
development."

Rin
"Even if there is another incident, I intend to conceal the evidence."

Yuna
"You really think people will follow you that way?"

Rin
"I am not alone in my thinking."

Rin
"We are researching ways to extract the vast energy that sleeps in Spira, and
use it to power machina."

Paine
"You're a jackass."

Rin
"I will take that as a compliment."



***Dialogue with Shinra from Final Fantasy X-2***
Shinra
"Aha..."

Yuna
"What are you looking at?"

Shinra
"Farplane data."

Shinra
"The more I study it, the more fascinating it gets. There's limitless energy
swirling around in there."

Yuna
"Limitless energy?"

Shinra
"The life force that flows through our planet...I think."

Shinra
"With a little work, we could probably extract the energy in a useable form."

Brother
"Sweet!"

Shinra
"Of course, that'd take generations."

Brother
"That's no fun!"

Buddy
"Well, still, it is something worth shooting for."

Yuna
"Think how much Spira would change if we ever got it to work!"

Yuna
"Maybe one day we could build a city full of light, one that never sleeps!"

Shinra
"No doubt about it."



***Dialogue with Rikku from Final Fantasy X-2: International+Last Mission***
Paine
"These days, people are always looking for sunken machina."

Rikku
"Yup-yup!"

Yuna
"Oh? Has Shinra been helping you with that?"

Rikku
"Ahh, now that you bring it up..."

Rikku
"Well, he left the ship and got together with Rin, and what do you think all
that research they've been doing is about?"



***Interview with Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima in the Final Fantasy X
Ultimania Omega*** (Page 191)
**FFVII and FFX are connected?!**
--"Previously, with a conversation in the FFX Scenario Ultimania, you made
certain inferences, and since it's been about half a year since then, is there
anything new you'd like to clarify about FFX?"

Kitase
"That's true...... Now that FFX International is out and we're in the future,
I'm in a predicament; it really isn't that hard to think of another story
[set] in that world; room for expansion was left possible there without too
much difficulty, don't you think? Speaking conversely, FFX received a splendid
reception and made us think of adding to it."

Nojima
"After FFVII was finished, we were easily able to add Zack's open[-ended role]
into the International version. But, with X, there was an older story with a
partly-finished world and an opening that this new one could be added to and
[, in doing] so[,] complete it."

Kitase
"So, you could say [in terms of] time, Nojima-san decided to designate it to
act as a sequel to VII, if you follow me."


--"It's a sequel to VII!!"

Kitase
"Well, there was a joke right there. Simply put, in VII's ending, Holy came,
and the next thing you knew, it was over without closing things up, and then
it was the "500 years later" [scene] in the future. There's a large margin
buried there. A margin for the imagination. Nojima-san and Toriyama are going
to be filling something of that with VII, though, while they're at their best
and can do it."


--"So, will it become a sequel to VII's story?"

Nojima
"I have a strong feeling that they're going to be connected."


--"Huh, so VII and X ARE connected?"

Nojima
"Well, there's not many specifics to it. I know that what becomes of people
when they die is among them; you could say that it's basically the same. Both
[concepts came to] function along the same line of thought as I wrote the
stories. Sometimes my thoughts just flow out like that, even though pyreflies
distinctly aren't green."


--"When you speak of the dead becoming [something] green, do you perhaps
[mean]......?"

Nojima
"Yes. In my mind, pyreflies and VII's Lifestream are the same substance."

Kitase
"Nojima-san's even considering making use of an idea like this -- [with] an
addition to the idea of life origin -- in a sequel to FFX International.
That's just a little bit of the thought that's been going into what to do with
VII."

Nojima
"That's right. There's something like the Lifestream [in X's world
also]......."


--"'An addition to the idea of life origin'......does that mean you're going
to revise life origin concepts or something?"

Nojima
"I can't say......it's a secret (laughs)."

Kitase
"It's a surprise with how someone from the story conducts theirself with
regards to the Farplane."



***Interview with FFX-2 creators from the Final Fantasy X-2 Ultimania***
(Page 723)
**"So, what of this child, Shinra......"**
--"Among these latest stories, 'connected' is one of the key words becoming
applicable, isn't it?"

[Daisuke] Watanabe
"I personally like the word 'connected,' but there's one aspect where that
applies well."

Nojima
"During the game's progression, various vague things will be tied together to
reveal it."


--"For example, the name 'Shinra' suggests a connection with VII? There's
[what's said] in the 'Graduation Mission' scenario [ -- 'graduation'
referring to Shinra being soon to leave the Gullwings -- ], and the 'I am not
alone in my thinking' line from the 'Rin's Detective Work' scenario seems to
have some particular significance."

Nojima
"Actually, it does. After quitting the Gullwings, Shinra received enormous
financial support from Rin, and began trying to use Vegnagun to siphon Mako
Energy from the Farplane. But, he is unable to complete the system for
utilizing this energy in his generation, and in the future, when traveling to
distant planets becomes possible, the Shin-Ra Company is founded on another
world, or something like that....... That would happen about 1000 years after
this story, I think."


--"So VII's story is after that?"

Nojima
"Well, you could say the feelings I have are like that. When I think about the
characters, those are the kinds of feelings I already have. Shinra is a good
child, but his descendants are going to end up becoming like the president [of
Shin-Ra] (laughs)."

Watanabe
"With you said about VII, after seeing your episodes with Shinra, one of the
people on the [development] staff said that the first shot of the Bevelle
Underground 'gives the impression of somewhere else.'"

[Motomu] Toriyama
"Certainly; it looks like the opening shot of Midgar in VII."



***Information on Shinra of the Gullwings in the Final Fantasy VII Ultimania
Omega*** (Page 563)
Shinra is a boy who supports the Gullwings, the group which the main
protagonist, Yuna, belongs to. He carries a name that gives him an association
to the Shin-Ra Company, and he is researching a method that could utilize the
energy of "the life force that flows through our planet." The results of this
cannot be seen in FFX-2, but maybe one day his descendants will establish a
"company that supplies the energy of the planet"?

(Accompanying screenshot caption)
The words of Shinra, which can be heard at the end of the story. This world
has something similar to the Lifestream that is worthy of attention.



***Interview with FFVII creators from the Final Fantasy VII Ultimania
Omega*** (Page 571)
--"At E3 (the world's largest game show, which was held in America), as a demo
for the PS3, the opening of FFVII was shown; was its purpose to serve as
something of a preliminary announcement?

Kitase
"Well, in regard to that, please think of it as a mere demonstration. Because
the production period for its imagery was [going to be] so short, we made the
opening of FFVII, as it was easy to represent. Beyond that, there is no
particular deeper meaning.


--"In that case, it's not a remake; when might you be making something to
serve as the direct continuation of FFX-2?"

Kitase
"Producing something like that holds the same problem as a remake [of FFVII],
as our schedule just isn't open for it [right now]."



***Information concerning the Shera and fuel in the Advent Children Reunion
Files book*** (Page 87)
What do they use for fuel in this time period?
"Cloud and the gang certainly aren't using mako anymore, because it drains the
life of the planet. That means they don't use Materia, either. Yuffie collects
them, but that's just because she lives to collect things (laughs). I guess
the airship must be running on some mysterious ancient power source." (Nomura)





****Notes on information in the Advent Children Reunion Files book**** (008)
As you, the reader, may or may not know, Final Fantasy VII's direct sequel,
Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, has an Ultimania-like book of its own: the
Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Reunion Files book published by SoftBank.
This comprehensive book features in-depth information on each character in the
film, interviews with their voice actors, interviews with the film's core
creators, a lengthy production digest of the film, and a wealth of info on
aspects of the film's plot.

I have here collected a lot of the more interesting and notable information
from the book, broken it down into categories, and sorted it accordingly. Be
aware, though, that this is not necessarily everything you personally may find
of interest in the book, and that I'll not be quoting anything from it here,
neither in English or Japanese. I'll simply be paraphrasing. This is because
the book is actually in both English and Japanese -- being the only Final
Fantasy book I know of to be bilingual -- and I recommend it to all fans of
the film who can read either language. As one who owns more than a dozen
official Final Fantasy books, this is absolutely my favorite one.

Without further ado, here's the information from the book:

***Production notes*** (008.1)
-The short CG production by Square's Visual Works department (the project that
eventually became Advent Children) was began in January of 2002. It wasn't
until March of 2003 (when Final Fantasy X-2 was released in Japan) that the
official go-ahead was given to the Advent Children project itself. In other
words, you can say that Advent Children's pre-production began in January of
2002.

-The real world footage from AC's credits and Reminisicence of Final Fantasy
VII was filmed in Hawaii.

-Takeyuki Takeya (the monster and mechanical art designer for the film)
designed Cloud's First Tsurugi sword set used in the film. He says that he
doesn't know what the individual names of the swords are, nor what their
specific attributes are. "First Tsurugi" is, apparently, the name for the
entire set and the completed sword (as most people thought, I believe), and
the swords were just called "the fusion swords" during development because
they weren't given proper names.

-Takeyuki Takeya also designed Bahamut Sin (whose design he said was partly
inspired by Jomon pottery) and the Shera airship.

-Yusuke Naora designed the Velvet Nightmares and the Dual Hound (Loz and
Yazoo's weapons).

-Nomura said he didn't do the designs for the weapons, creatures, and the
Shera airship because he wanted to focus on directing.

-Yusuke Naora's location design of the shell structure in the Forgotten
Capital (Kadaj's base) was the first piece drawn in the film's pre-production.

-Nojima said that he got the idea for Geostigma from a plot element originally
intended for Final Fantasy X, but that wasn't implemented. The idea was that
Yuna would have been going around curing diseases all over Spira. He said that
since he needed a plot element to cause Cloud to need to protect people
weaker than him, he came up with Geostigma.

-Nojima said that he set AC 2 years after FFVII because it's a pretty long
time, but also short enough for the past to still be lingering in people's
minds. He also said it was long enough for Marlene to have probably started
talking a lot.

-Nomura had Cloud take down Kadaj without really grunting or showing any signs
of straining himself so that when he was grunting a lot during his fight with
Sephiroth and displaying lots of signs of fatigue it would emphasise how much
more powerful Sephiroth was.

-When designing Sephiroth for the film, they took various steps to make him
seem like something other than an ordinary human, a supernatural entity. For
his appearance, they gave him slanted eyes. In rendering him, they never
showed him blink. For his lines, Nojima gave him a majestic style of speech
that would suggest that his mentality had ascended beyond that of ordinary
humans.

-Nomura said that since Barret is compared to Mr. T so often, they
deliberately went out of their way to make him look different from him in
Advent Children (yes, he actually said this).

-At one point, the development team was unsure of why Sephiroth would appear
to fight Cloud, and were only certain that he must appear for a final battle
with him. They considered various ideas, including Sephiroth only being
visible to Cloud, but ultimately went with what we see in the finished film
(Kadaj's fusion with Jenova's cells).

-The Madhouse animation studio was selected to create Last Order because they
had been used on the anime trailer for Before Crisis, and because the
company's president was very enthusiastic about the idea of a FFVII animated
feature, and frequently payed visits to Nomura at SE's offices to discuss the
idea with him. Because of the enormous support Madhouse was expressing for the
project, they were a shoe-in for the job.

-Despite how simple a garment it was, Cid's t-shirt was apparently an
extremely difficult piece to animate realistically. Initially, it came off
looking rubbery.

-Apparently Yazoo's hair was a pain in the ass to animate.

-The original promotional video for AC shown at the Tokyo Game Show in 2003
was all of the development footage that Nomura and his people had at the time.
Since they knew they would be unveiling the project only 6 months after it had
finally gotten an official go-ahead, Nomura wanted to pack the preview with
action shots and then focus on developing everything else around them later.

-The English version's April 3, 2006 premiere is mentioned, as is the fact
that it was met to a thunderous warm welcome. This is probably what prompted
the delay of the book from May 2 to May 22. It's not explicitly stated, but
I'm guessing that it was this large show of support from English-reading fans
that made SE or SoftBank decide to include English translations of all of the
Japanese text in the book (with the exception of a little bit of the
production credits in the back). This was the first time this was done with an
FF book to my knowledge.

-Mideel was originally going to be used as the film's therapeutic location,
but the development team decided to create Healin and utilize it instead
because of how far Mideel is from Midgar/Edge.

-It was the "Deep Dive" hidden FMV from the original Kingdom Hearts that
sparked a desire in Nomura to try making an even more cool-looking battle
scene in a CG film in the future. He had a specific desire to use FFVII as the
source material, and being that Visual Works had wanted to make a FFVII CG
production anyway, once Nomura agreed to go on the project as its director,
things gradually took shape.

-In initial sketches, Kadaj was referred to as "Lost Name" because he didn't
have a name yet.

-The original subtitle of the film was going to be "Reunion," but Nomura felt
that the word didn't convey the sense of "coming back again" well enough, so
he did some research and found the word "advent," which is often used to mean
"second coming." Nojima, for his part, wanted "children" in the title, so the
two words were combined. Nojima says he feels that the title does a good job
of expressing that FFVII is back and that Sephiroth is going to come back
during the film.

-Nomura said back around the time of Parasite Eve's production, he had come up
with an idea for a game that involved a cat and a dog searching for their
missing master. The cat would ride on the dog's back. This idea is what led
Nomura to think of sticking Cait Sith on Red XIII's back after they decided
not to use Cait Sith's Moogle mount.

-Nomura says he gave Denzel wavy hair to make him more unique since it's not a
common trait with FFVII's characters.

-The Shadow Creepers' heads were based on crows' skulls.

-At one point they considered having Yazoo and Loz holding the Shadow Creepers
from the beginning on leashes while they rode their motorcycles, but decided
not to.

-Originally, the scene with Kadaj talking to Aerith after Sephiroth fell
wasn't included. However, they decided to add this scene in late in the
production because they wanted to give Kadaj a scene of salvation, as they
felt that he was a character who needed to be saved too.


***Character and plot notes*** (008.2)
-Kadaj, Loz, and Yazoo are referred to as physical manifestations of
Sephiroth's spirit and will three times in the English text, with the specific
wording used in Japanese being something akin to "will bodies of Sephiroth's
thoughts" on one of those occasions and "phantoms of Sephiroth" on another.
Also, Kadaj is said to represent Sephiroth's cruelty, while Yazoo represents
his allure and Loz represents his strength.

-It's confirmed that the silver-haired men's desire to find Jenova's remains
and merge with them is due in part to Sephiroth's desire to be restored
goading them without them knowing it.

-It's stated that Sephiroth and Kadaj are left-handed. Most likely Yazoo and
Loz are as well since -- like Kadaj -- they are physical manifestations of
Sephiroth's spirit and feature some of his attributes. That in mind along with
the fact that Loz's Dual Hound weapon is on his left arm and being that Yazoo
chooses to use his left hand to fire his Velvet Nightmare when fighting with
only one gun, we have reason to believe this is true.

-It's said that the SHM concluded that the remains of Jenova were under the
Meteor monument and commanded the kids to surround it as human shields.
Apparently when the children's Reunion instinct led them to Edge, the SHM
concluded that the remains of Jenova must be under the monument because Rufus
had built it.

-An in-universe explanation for why Loz often moves with a blue blur behind
him is not given. It's simply said that because he's so big and bulky, they
wanted to off-set his girth by making him look really fast and used the blue
blur only for him to emphasise that he's fast. It's not suggested -- despite
how often people think so -- that it has anything to do with his Dual Hound.

-No explanation for where the SHM got their bikes is offered, but Takeyuki
Takeya said that he designed the SHM's bikes with the impression that they're
very generic and that there might be tons of bikes just like them. They
probably stole them from somewhere.

-No explanation for the SHM's cell phones is offered either. However, I bet
they stole them from Elena and Tseng since they had to get the other Turks'
numbers somehow.

-It's mentioned that after Sephiroth jumped into the Lifestream back in
Nibelheim, his body dissolved, but because of his powerful will, he reformed
it at the Northern Crater, where his life energy and Jenova's head were washed
to. This most likely is why he only seemed to have a torso when he cast Meteor
(he was still reforming his original body), and why the Ultimania Omega says
that he was regenerating in the Northern Crater.

-The Shadow Creepers are referred to as Summons (capital "s").

-Nomura implied that the Shera runs on some ancient non-mako technology, as
confirmed in Dirge of Cerberus. Thought not explicitly stated either here or
in Dirge of Cerberus, this is most likely part of the FFVII-FFX/X-2
connection (see the section on this within this FAQ for more information about
it).

-Rufus had the Meteor monument built to serve as a reminder of the tragedy. I
guess -- since he blamed his company for the Meteor disaster and the planet's
weakened state -- he wanted people to remember the errors humanity had made in
the past.

-It's said that Cloud was outmatched when it came to the fight with Sephiroth.
Sorry everybody who thinks that Cloud was almost on par with him: he wasn't.
Even worse for Cloud, Nomura said that Sephiroth didn't sweat during the
entire fight and never exerted himself. In other words, he wasn't even trying
hard. Cloud on the other hand was clearly giving it his all and was described
by the book as exhausted by the time the battle was nearing its conclusion.

-It's said that Loz fights Tifa to amuse himself. Sorry everybody who thinks
that Tifa was probably as strong as him or stronger: she wasn't.

-Nojima said that Vincent has to be dragged into something before he'll take
action, and that if it wasn't for the other members of Avalanche being his
friends, he probably wouldn't have joined the fight against Bahamut Sin.

-Vincent's revelation to Cloud in the Sleeping Forest that he had never tried
to forgive himself for the things he had blamed himself for was one of the
major factors that caused Cloud to realize what he needed to do.

-The entire movie occurs over the course of 3 days, beginning at noon on Day 1
and ending at 7:00 AM on Day 3. In othe words, the film occurs over the course
of 43 hours.

-The fight between Avalanche and Bahamut Sin/the fight between Reno and Rude
and Yazoo and Loz lasts 2 hours.

-The motorcycle chase up through the moment Sephiroth appears lasts another 2
hours.

-Cloud's final battle with Sephiroth began at 6:00 PM on the story's second
day and he woke up at 7:00 AM in Aerith's church on the third day. There's no
suggestion of how long he was unconscious, but I'd guess it was anywhere from
10 to 12 hours.

-Nomura said that Midgar covered in greenery 500 years after the Meteor
incident symbolizes humans re-embracing nature. Perhaps they won't go with
humans dying out after all, as Kitase indicated may happen during an interview
with Electronic Gaming Monthly in October, 2005.

-Fuel for the love triangle debate: Nomura refers to Tifa as being many
things, including a lover/sweetheart (in a romantic/sexual context; "koibito"
is the Japanese word used here), and Nojima says that when he began writing
the script for Advent Children, the first thing he was sure of being part of
the setting is that Cloud and Tifa were together. That said, Nomura may have
meant that Tifa's a lover in the same way people will say "I'm a lover, not a
fighter," and Nojima may not have meant "together" in a romantic context. For
the record, I think Tifa's got this won, but that's me personally. Let the war
continue!

-Nojima says that when the water drop appeared in Aerith's church after Cloud
and Tifa fell unconscious, their wounds were healed. He said he wanted that
water drop to serve as foreshadowing of Aerith's later appearance in the
church, as they had given Aerith a watery theme for this movie.

-Nomura says that despite people often thinking that Rude's black, he thinks
that Rude's appearance is more of a South American look.

-Nojima said that even though Rufus' wheelchair was part of his disguise, he
really did suffer a lot of injuries from Diamond WEAPON's attack and isn't in
the best shape.

-Nojima says that Reno's not so much interested in rebuilding the Shin-Ra
Company because he thinks it should be rebuilt. He just thinks the idea sounds
cool and exciting.

-Nomura refers to Red XIII as being "a feline of sorts" and jokes that
sticking Cait Sith on him made for more of a cat riding a bigger cat than a
cat riding a dog like the idea that had inspired Red XIII carrying Cait Sith.

-The kanji used for "Sin"/"Shin" in Bahamut Sin's name means "tremor" or
"quake." For those unfamiliar with this kanji, it's the first kanji in the
dual kanji word "shindou," which means "tremor" or "impact." They used the
kanji for "shin" in this book, while rendering it in katakana in the AC
Prologue book from September, 2005.

-According to Nomura, the use of materia drains the planet's life energy, this
being why the good guys don't use it anymore. There's not an explanation for
why its use drains the planet's energy, but based on Sephiroth's explanation
from the original game that materia links someone to the planet and allows
them to use its powers, its most likely that the materia allows someone to tap
into the Lifestream's energy and manifest it as a spell based on the specs of
the materia they're using. This would, of course, drain the planet's energy,
the same as turning it into electricity would.


***Miscellaneous notes*** (008.3)
-On Yazoo's page, it refers to the Velvet Nightmares as "gunblades" in the
English text. This is strange because it doesn't do that in the Japanese text,
and this reference to the weapons as gunblades never shows up again. Of
course, they aren't like the gunblades in Final Fantasy VIII even if these
weapons are meant to be classified as such, because those weapons could only
be used as swords (according to FFVIII's Ultimania) and the Velvet Nightmares
can only be used as guns (according to all of the official AC sites).

-Kazushige Nojima's first name is mistakenly written as "Kazunari" at one
point in English, most likely a result of "Kazunari" and "Kazushige" sharing
the same kanji. I've seen this mistake before.

-They don't keep certain romanizations consistent in the English text. "Veld"
is written as both "Veld" and "Verdot" on the same page in the Before Crisis
section, and "Shears" is written as both "Shears" and "Sears."

-The name of "Elfe" from Before Crisis is written as "Elfe" without an accent
mark over the "e" to emphasise it be pronounced as "eh."

-Rosso from Dirge of Cerberus is referred to with "he" instead of "she."
Obviously a mistake, as she is very much a woman.

-Vice's/Weiss' (also from Dirge of Cerberus) name is romanized as "Weiss."
Hopefully it stays that way for the English versions of DoC, as "Weiss"
actually does mean "white" in German (all of the elite Zvet SOLDIERs in DoC
are named for colors).

-At one point in the English text, Nojima refers to Sephiroth's motivation
largely being revenge against Cloud because of how badly his pride was hurt
when Cloud turned the tables on him in the Mt. Nibel mako reactor. More
notably, it says that this defeat was made all the worse because Cloud was a
"rookie SOLDIER" at the time. This, of course, is a mistake, as Cloud was
never in SOLDIER, and the Japanese text there doesn't say "SOLDIER." At least
not in reference to the elite squad, which is always written in katakana. It
uses the kanji for "rookie soldier," meaning a regular private in the army.
Just thought this should be pointed out before we had people going "They're
contradicting their own continuity!" or "I knew Nojima was on LSD!"

-The pink ribbons the characters wear are confirmed to be in remembrance of
Aerith.

-The angel statue in Edge and the number of birds flying over Midgar in the
opening apparently don't have any specific meaning after all. Nomura said that
they had a meaning to him and members of the production staff in a previous
interview (I think it was in the AC Prologue book), but apparently they don't
have specific universal meanings like the wolf that symbolizes Cloud's guilt.
Apparently Nomura just wanted to make people give more thought to what they
were watching (that's my guess).

-Nomura said that he sees Vincent and Cloud as being very much alike, only
Vincent acts and speaks older (probably because he is).

-The Japanese voice actor for Yuffie has been serving as her voice actor since
Ehrgeiz came out.

-The guy who did Cait Sith's voice also did the Japanese voices of Auron
(Final Fantasy X and X-2), Tobli (Final Fantasy X-2), and Squall Leonhart
(Kingdom Hearts I and II).

-The young guy who did Roxas' Japanese voice in Kingdom Hearts II auditioned
to do the voice of Denzel, but Nomura felt he was too old for the role.
However, it was this audition that made Nomura think he would be perfect for
playing Roxas.
