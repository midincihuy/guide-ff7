a battle, just look at the Boss & Battle list and type in the code in front
when searching. For example B23 for Demon's Gate.

Not reading it is not a wise choice if you want to do a Speed Run, so take your

                                  1.2 <> Intro
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A Speed Run is in my opinion the best challenge for any game ever. You have one
simple goal: Beat the game as fast as you can, using whatever the game has to
offer, except bugs and glitches. That's it. But why would that be the best
challenge ever? Well, there are many reasons. First of all because it's fun. If
you think you're good at a game, you can test your skills and knowledge in a
Speed Run. You will most likely do some mistakes the first time, but just give
it another try and you will beat your record. You can do it many times, and it
won't get boring until you can't beat your record. I have done eight FFVII runs
myself, including three test runs, and so far it has just gotten more and more
fun each time. Of course, this increases the replay value of the game.

It's also the most popular challenge out there, and you can find many websites
dedicated to Speed Runs. People from all over the world come to these sites and
discuss strategies and they even record their runs so that everyone can see
them. As of June 4th, Farringa has recorded a complete FFVII run, that should
be available at the Speed Demos Archive (http://speeddemosarchive.com/) within
the month. As for me, I'm currently recording my "perfect" run and I will
submit it to SDA when it's done. In the meantime, I will upload every segment
to Youtube as I proceed.

My Youtube channel: http://www.youtube.com/GarlandTheGreat

This FAQ will guide you through the challenge and by following it, you should
be able to beat the game in less than 12 hours, even if you've only beaten the
game once. You will find all the necessary information you need in order to
complete the challenge and the walkthrough will have all the best and fastest
strategies for shaving off time. Every time you have to save, you will find my
record time and recommended times for 9, 10 and 12 hour runs. The 12 hours run
is for beginners, the 10 hours run is for advanced players and the 9 hours run
is for experts. Since my record is 8:57:59, I won't make any recommended times
for a 9 hours run this time. If you have beaten the game a fair amount of times
and have some experience, you should have no trouble beating it in 10 hours by
following the guide. I have received emails from several people saying they
beat their first run in less than 10 hours, so it's far from impossible.

A Speed Run is similar to a Low Level Game in many ways. To save time, you can
only fight boss battles, other mandatory battles and certain enemies to learn
enemy skills, so your levels will always stay low. Your levels won't be any
higher than 45 by the end of the game. Because of that, it is recommended to
have beaten a regular Low Level Game if you want to achieve a good time. If you
aren't used to fighting on low levels, this challenge could get far more
difficult than you had expected. Well, challenges are supposed to be difficult
after all, so I won't stop you even if you've only beaten the game once.

Some people deny the fact that this is a true Speed Run. They claim that a
Speed Run must be beaten in one sitting and the time spent from the very moment
you select "NEW GAME" until Sephiroth is dead is your final time. Anything you
do in the meantime will be included in the final time. In other words, you
cannot load up and play a part over again if you screw up. If you do that, you
will just get a crappier result. I get the point, but I couldn't disagree more.
That's more like the ODINS and HDINS challenges (these have an own section in
this new version of the guide), just that you're allowed to save in case you
should get a game over. The challenge described in this guide is indeed a Speed
Run, and I can't understand why you shouldn't be allowed to save, load up and
play a part over again until you achieve the best result. That's what a Speed
Run is all about after all.

As I said, I have done eight Speed Runs myself, including three test runs and
the HDINS Challenge. Here are the results:

1. Early 2003     - 11:04
2. Late 2003      - 10:14
3. April 2004     -  9:29
4. June 2004      -  9:46 (test)
5. July 2004      -  8:39
6. May 2005       - 11:50 (HDINS)
7. September 2005 - 10:41 (test)
8. April 2006     -  8:36 (test)

All the times are from the final saves. The 4th, 7th and 8th runs were test
runs where my only intention was to test new strategies, so I didn't put much
effort into them, something you can see from the results. I wrote the first
version of this FAQ during the first test run, but I found out a lot of things
that could've been done better during this run. I also had three people testing
this version of the guide; KADFC, lolo26 and Bergqvist, who also came up with
a lot of new ideas and strategies, so I decided to start over and re-write the
FAQ. I ended up beating my old record with 50 minutes and I set a record that
everybody thought was incredible. However, I knew that I had made a couple of
mistakes, so I decided that I would do another run one day, but first I needed
a long break from Speed Runs. In May 2005, me and lolo started discussing Speed
Runs again and we came up with a lot of new strategies. Lolo did a test run
with the PC version where he tested these new strategies and he set an
incredible new record. We came to the conclusion that the game could be beaten
in less than 9 hours. Then, a guy named BrutalAl showed up and he had a lot of
new ideas as well, so we all started testing stuff again and finally we came to
the conclusion that the game could be beaten in less than 8:30. Time will show
when the final perfect run is over. I'm the guy writing this guide, but we have
all contributed with ideas and strategies and my record would never been as
good without the other guys.


If you've played FFIX, you may remember what Amarant says before entering
Ipsen's Castle.

"working alone beats working in a team any day, and I'm gonna prove it."

You know what? I just proved him wrong. As I said, my record would never have
been as good without the other guys. Co-work rocks!


There's one more thing I'd like to say in this intro. After completing the
third Speed Run in April 2004, I created a topic about it on the message board
and most people didn't believe me. Beating the game that fast was impossible
and I was obviously lying since I didn't have any evidence. They said that the
world record was 14 hours (or something like that), so there was no way I could
reach the bottom of the crater in 9:29. That was two years ago. Now, I have
beaten that record with more than an hour. What if I'd said 8:25 back then? The
main reason why I couldn't beat the game that fast was because the bosses would
pwn me on low levels and other crap. No good arguments whatsoever. Back then,
I was really pissed, but today I just find it amusing. I mean, there are just
too many ignorant people in this world that don't know what they're talking
about. I have proved the n00bs on the message board wrong so many times it's
almost scary. Thankfully, you don't see many of these n00bs nowadays. Now, you
can usually post a challenge topic without ten people saying it's impossible. I
guess this FAQ and all the other challenge FAQs are the main reason for that.

Although there are many idiots out there, some people just can't be blamed.
Let's take an example. When I was playing FFIX for the first time back in 2001,
this guy told me that you have to reach the end of the game in less than 12
hours to get the best weapon. I was like "no way, that's not possible" as I had
spent like 60 hours beating the game. But then I did some thinking and realized
that I had too little knowledge about the game to question the challenge, and
that's my advice for all the unbelievers out there. Don't question a challenge
if you have too little knowledge about a game. There are always better players
with tons of skills, knowledge and experience out there, and these people can
do stuff you never thought was possible. I have beaten FFVII in less than nine
hours and it's up to you if you want to believe me or not. But seriously, do
you honestly think I've spent hundreds of hours writing a joke FAQ?


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               1.3 <> Gaming Info
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS SECTION IS VERY IMPORTANT, AND I STRONGLY ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO READ AND
UNDERSTAND IT BEFORE YOU START PLAYING. YOU WILL FIND THE MOST IMPORTANT INFO
YOU NEED IN ORDER TO SAVE TIME HERE, SO YOU HAVE TO READ IT, NO MATTER WHAT.


                                     Rules
                                    #######

Yes, there are a few rules for the challenge.

* The save point must be placed at the bottom of the crater, in the area where
  you meet up with the party before the last battles. This place is also known
  as the point of no return, and if you open the menu here, it will say "Bottom
  of Nothern Cave". That's right, another typo. Think of this area as a clock,
  and place the save point at 8. At least don't go any further than 9, or the
  cutscenes will start.

* You must be able to beat the final bosses directly from the final save. If
  you somehow can't, you will have to go back and obtain whatever's needed and
  then save again. The time spent doing this will then be included in the final
  time, thus making it crappier. You shouldn't have to worry about this if you
  follow the FAQ.

* The game is considered beaten when you no longer have control over the game,
  and that's when you deal the final blow to Sephiroth in the final battle with
  him. There's still text to skip after Safer-Sephiroth and you have the choice
  of whether or not to use Omnislash against Sephiroth, so the game is not
  considered beaten until you've defeated him.



                                 Random battles
                                ################

All random battles must be escaped. No questions asked. Trust me, the levels
you may gain from fighting battles will not make up for the time spent.

The time it takes to escape a battle varies. Some times, you will escape before
the enemies get to act, but other times you may not be able to escape before
all the enemies have attacked. Thankfully, you will escape after one attack
most of the time. Since all battles theoretically can be escaped before the
enemies start attacking, you will lose time every time an enemy attacks you
throughout the game. You can live with one or two attacks in a regular run, but
restart if you get attacked too many times.

Attacks from both sides is something you don't want to happen. These cannot be
escaped before you defeat the enemies on one of the sides and needless to say,
that takes time. Also take note that you will lose four times as much health
when an enemy attacks a character from behind in these battles, so you might
get killed if the enemies are too strong. Consider an attack from both sides an
instant restart in most cases. Thankfully, it doesn't happen very often.



                                 Skipping text
                                ###############

All text must be skipped as fast as possible. I will tell you to [skip text] a
million times in the walkthrough, so you better get used to it. Whenever you
see the [skip text] box, you simply have to tap the action button until the
talking is over. If there's only one box of text to skip, I will in most cases
not bother with a [skip text], but simply tell you to skip one box of text or
something like that.

Many times, there will be options to select, like when the guards are chasing
Aerith in the church. You know what I mean. When you have to select the first
option, I won't bother telling you, so it will just say [skip text] as usual.
If another option has to chosen, I will of course let you know, as selecting
the wrong option in most cases will cause you to lose time.

Something you have to do seven times during the game is naming characters, but
you're not free to call them whatever you want. Since it takes a certain amount
of time to display a character, you have to shorten everyone's name to one
character. That's right. This is one of BrutalAl's many brilliant ideas. You
only save a few seconds overall by doing this, but it's still a brilliant idea.



                                     Saving
                                    ########

First of all, make sure to use a memory card with no other FFVII files. The
more files, the longer it takes to load the memory card before you get to save.

We save for several reasons in this challenge. The most important ones are
those where we save to avoid a random encounter. Yes, that's true. Many times,
saving will make the next battle go away. The random encounters aren't random
in this game. Start a new game and run through the first reactor as fast as you
can a couple of times, and you'll know what I mean. The battles always occur at
the same places all the time. Yup.

Sometimes, we can save to prevent the next battle from occuring, and since
saving takes less time than escaping a battle, we have to take this opportunity
to save time whenever it's possible. The first time we do this is when we save
before Guard Scorpion. If you don't save, you will get a battle on your way
back to the save point, but by saving, it "disappears". You have to soft-reset
first though. If you continue on after saving, it won't disappear. The same
thing also works on the world map, and not only that; it works all the time!
However, the pattern of encounters can vary from time to time on the world map,
so you can't do a practice run first to find out exactly where the next
encounter occurs and then save just before this point in the major run.

Thanks to this "system" or whatever we should call it (it's definitely not a
glitch), we get to save pretty often without losing any time at all, but
unfortunately, we can't just save at these occasions. Some times, there's a
tricky part that requires luck coming up, and it may have been a while since we
last saved, so saving would be wise. Even though we lose time by saving, we
could have lost more time if we had to play that part over again. It can also
be that we just got past a tricky part after tons of attempts, and you never
know what can happen. Other times we just save because it's been a while, and
playing a long part over again because of a small mistake ain't fun.



                                 Using the menu
                                ################

Since this is a Speed Run, you have to be fast when using the menu, and it's
very important when you have to do many things. You could easily lose a minute
fumbling around in the menu.

Sometimes, you have to do many changes in equipment and materia before boss
battles, and in these cases, it's a very good idea to save first. Then you
should practice doing the changes until you get fast and you can do it with
your eyes closed. Of course, you don't have to be lightning fast unless you're
a perfect runner, but even regulars should give it five minutes.



                            The use of limit breaks
                           #########################

This is something most people find out the first time they play the game, that
limit breaks have priority before anything else. When you have a character use
a limit break, it will always be used right away, no matter whose turn it is.

Usually, when fighting a single opponent, your characters get one turn each
before it's the opponent's turn again, but by taking advantage of the limit
break system, you can have a character act twice before the opponent's turn.
If all three characters have limit breaks, you can get a total of six turns
between the opponent's turn and thus save time. Let me explain how to do this.

Let's say your party is Cloud, Barret and Cid and you're fighting Proud Clod,
using Magic Breath to deal damage. Proud Clod attacks Cloud and he gets a limit
break. Now you have an opportunity to act four times before it's Proud Clod's
turn again. To make this work, you must have Cloud act first and then the
others. Let's say you have Barret act second and then Cid. Cloud will now cast
Magic Breath first and his ATB bar will start filling up when it's Barret's
turn. Then Barret casts Magic Breath and by the time he's done, Cloud's ATB bar
should be full. Then it's Cid's turn, and now it's time to activate Cloud's
limit break. Just make sure you don't activate it too early, or he will use it
before Cid's turn. Do it when Cid starts moving and you see the text "Magic
Breath" at the top of the screen. After Cid is done casting Magic Breath, Cloud
will use his limit break and you successfully got four turns in a row.

That's how it works. Test it out in a regular battle a couple of times, and
you'll easily learn how to handle it. It's not very complicated after all. Just
take note that when you're fighting on the highest battle speed, which you must
do in a Speed Run, you don't necessarily have to let the character who got a
limit break act first. Since the ATB gauge fills pretty fast, you can let this
character act second and still be able to use the limit break before it's the
enemy's turn again.

Note: This only works with ATB at Active. We change to Recommended and Wait a
few times during the run, so it won't work then.



                              To do or not to do?
                             #####################

You can only do the necessary things in order to proceed with the story. You
have no time to visit places you don't have to, like the Chocobo Farm, Gongaga,
the Shinra Mansion and so on. But why would you anyway? I have gotten a couple
of emails from people saying they've beaten the game in 15 hours, but they did
this and that sidequest. Seriously, folks, this is a Speed Run, and in a Speed
Run, your goal is to beat the game as fast as possible. Why the hell do you
want to do sidequests? If you love the sidequests so much, then beat the game
regularly, or save before you do them and then load up afterwards.

Also, you can only pick up the necessary items like the Fire Ring, Bolt Armlet,
Ribbon and so on. In some cases, we will spend time getting a certain item, but
don't worry; the item will make up for the time spent getting it, or else we
wouldn't have gotten it in the first place. There will be some shopping as
well, but mostly for items and materia. All the equipment we need will either
be found or won from enemies, except for one weapon, the Force Stealer, which
is bought in North Corel.



                               Speed is the key!
                              ###################

This is a Speed Run, so speed is naturally the key to success. If you play
racing games, you should know that you have to cut every turn as correctly as
possible in order to save time. Think racing in the fields and take the
shortest course. Doing so could prevent a battle and saving you 20 seconds, if
not more, so this is not for perfectionists only.



                         Patience, my friend! Patience!
                        ################################

If you want to achieve the best times, you will have to play certain parts over
and over again until you get the best results. And in some cases, there are
loads of things to do between a save and a boss fight that requires some luck
for the best result. Palmer and Red Dragon can be mentioned. If the battle
fails, you have to go through tons of cutscenes and dialogues before you get
another try. Carry Armor is an even better example, as you have to fight two
battles before you can take a shot at him, and many things can go wrong in
these battles as well. Of course, the amount of patience needed depends on how
fast you want to beat the game. If you have no patience at all, a Speed Run is
definitely not for you.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                    1.4 <> Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section contains questions that have been or may be asked. If you have a
question you think should be added here send me an email. Read section 5.2 for
info on how to contact me. Needless to say, only good questions will be added.


Q: Just how fast is it possible to beat the game?

A: With near-perfect execution and close to maximum luck manipulation, it is
   possible to beat the game in less than 7 hours and 45 minutes. Theoretically,
   you can get closer to the 7:30 mark, but that would require strategies with
   such low odds, it's no longer realistic. A TAS could probably get below 7:30.
   See the question further down if you don't know what a TAS is.



Q: How good is your record?

A: My current record is not that great. After all, it was only a test run, so I
   didn't put much effort into it. First timers will have a hard time beating
   it, but you can easily beat it if you're good.



Q: What about Cait Sith's Slots. Can I use them to instantly kill all bosses?

A: No, you can't. Using an instant win attacks is the only thing you can't do
   in a Speed Run. Just like Zanmato in FFX. Why, you may ask? Because we use
   skills, speed and strategy in a Speed Run, and an instant win attack isn't a
   strategy. We have discussed this matter, and our conclusion is that you can
   achieve a better result by using the Slots, but not a much better one.

   The Japanese Ultimania dudes have completed a Slot Run. Time: 7:26:37 and I
   think it was the time at the final save (not a 100% sure here). Also, the
   Japanese version is shorter by an unknown amount of time, as described in
   section 1.5, so that time can't be compared with my NTSC time.



Q: Is there any way to skip dialogues, cutscenes and FMVs?

A: I don't know if you can do this even with a gameshark, but you're not
   supposed to anyway. In a Speed Run, you play the game legitimately and any
   use of a cheating device is considered cheating. Text must be skipped by
   tapping the action button and all cutscenes and FMVs are to be watched
   normally. I know you can skip the FMVs in FFIX by opening the hatch/disc
   tray, but that's plain cheating in my opinion. And no, it doesn't work with
   FFVII. Thank God.



Q: Will the timer stop if I pause the game in battles?

A: Yes, it will. If you need a break and haven't saved for a long time, then
   pause the game during battle. There are no other ways to stop the timer.
   Don't ever leave the game in the middle of a dialogue or a cutscene. My
   phone once rang at Aerith's house when "listening" to Elmyra's story, and I
   had no other choice but to leave the game and then restart afterwards. Make
   sure nothing will interrupt you when you do this challenge. You can also
   pause the snowboard minigame.



Q: How do you get the seconds for your save times?

A: After saving, I note down the seconds shown by the timer when I get back to
   the menu again. If you load a file and open the menu at once, it will show
   three seconds more than this. If the seconds are between 00 and 02, for
   example 2:07:02, the save file will say 2:06 when you load the file. After
   saving at the end of a disc, I open the menu immediately on the next disc and
   then note down the seconds.



Q: I don't have a PS/PS2/PS3. Can I use the PC version for a speed run as well?

A: Yes, you can, but take note that the PC version is faster than the PS
   version, so you can never compare your times with mine. It's hard to say
   exactly how much faster it is, and it could depend on how fast your PC is as
   well, but I'm not sure about that. However, if you use the PC version, you 
   have to make sure to play on low resolution, as the timer seems to be very
   slow if you play on high resolution. Lolo told me that 60 seconds on the
   timer was actually 144, and I don't want any emails from people saying
   they've made it in 4 hours... :p

   There is a small issue regarding random battles for PC runners. On the way
   to the save point at Mt. Corel, you have to get into a battle with two Bombs
   on the bridge right before it. Farringa ran into some trouble here. When he
   first got here, he didn't get a battle with two Bombs on the bridge. Then,
   every time he loaded up to try again, he get the exact same battle on the
   way there, so he simply couldn't get a battle with two Bombs on the bridge.

   Thankfully, he found a solution to the problem too. When you get into the
   undesired (the battle you get instead of the 2x Bomb battle), make sure to
   kill your party so that you return to the title screen and load up. The
   battles should change. If you close the program instead of killing yourself,
   the battles won't change. If you don't get the right battle now, you must
   kill the party again and load up from the title screen. Do that until you
   get the right battle. Once you quit the program, the original battles will
   return, including the undesired one.



Q: If I use a PS2, does it make any difference if I set Disc Speed to Fast and
   Texture Mapping to Smooth?

A: Yes, it does. BrutalAl did some research and this is what he found out:

   I placed myself at the entrance of the 2nd house to the left in Kalm and ran
   inside, up the stairs, then down and out again. I repeated this procedure
   ten times in a row and then noticed how long it took me with the different
   PS2 settings.

   Disc Speed Fast, Texture Mapping Smooth: ~78 sec
   Disc Speed Standard, Texture Mapping Standard: ~107 sec

   My âcourseâ consisted of 40 screen load-ups so Disc Speed Fast saved me
   ~0.75 sec per screen load in this test. I also did another test where I just
   ran back and forth between two screens and in that test Disc Speed Fast
   saved me 0.9 sec per screen load (20 load-ups, 40 sec compared to 58).

   Also, I didnât do a full test of this but I did notice that the difference
   between Standard and Fast Disc Speed when Iâ¦
   -Loaded a save (on the world map)
   -Ran into Kalm
   -Ran into the Inn and then directly out again
   -Opened the menu
   â¦was more than 6 seconds on the menu timer.

   I tried to determine if Texture Mapping Standard or Smooth was the fastest
   but I couldnât come to an apparent conclusion, though some differences were
   observed. The longer course took 78 sec to run on average with Smooth and 79
   on average with Standard. The shorter course seemed to average just below 40
   sec with Smooth and just above 40 sec with Standard.

   Conclusion: Make sure to set Disc Speed to Fast and Texture Mapping to
   Smooth before you start playing. Just take note that the PS2 resets these
   settings every time you turn it off, so you have to do it every time you
   turn it on.



Q: How about that PS3? Does it load the game any faster?

A: No, it doesn't. A PS2 with the Fast & Smooth setup will load the game
   faster than a PS3. I don't know if the downloadable PSN version is faster or
   slower than the regular game, but it doesn't really matter unless you're
   going for the record. If you do, you have to make sure you have a PS2. And
   no, the PSN version has not been altered in any kind of way. It's the exact
   same game, so you can compare your PSN run to any other run console run.



Q: What's a perfect run?

A: As a matter of fact, there is no such thing as a perfect run. That's just
   what we call a near-perfect run. The purpose of a near-perfect run is to do
   things as perfect as possible and that's why we call it a perfect run. Read
   section 1.6 for more info and if you want to do this challenge.

   A true perfect run would mean only necessary saves (saving to avoid random
   encounters), the least amount of random encounters possible and all of them
   had to be escaped at once, before you got attacked by the enemies. You would
   also have to beat all bosses as fast as possible, using Cait Sith's Dice for
   maximum damage whenever that would be possible. And the list goes on. You
   couldn't do it even with all the luck in the world.



Q: What are the ODINS and HDINS Challenges?

A: ODINS = One Day In No Saves. Objective: Start a timer at the exact moment
   you select a new game and defeat the last Sephiroth within 24 hours without
   saving. You are not allowed to pause the timer, so anything you do in the
   meantime will be included in the final time. I'm sure anyone who has beaten
   the game at least five times should be able to pull this off without too
   much trouble. As long as you know what to do and where to go in order to
   proceed with the story, and you don't waste any time doing unneccessary
   things, you should have more than enough time to level up for bosses you
   think might be a problem. You don't have time to fight every random battle
   you get into, but spend some time fighting in areas with good battles. Just
   make sure you defeat the enemies as quickly as possible.

   HDINS = Half Day In No Saves. Same rules as ODINS, but the time limit is 12
   hours. Needless to say, this is A LOT tougher. This challenge is for experts
   only and it requires good speed run skills and full knowledge of the game
   from beginning to end. You have to be prepared for every thinkable situation
   and you must know exactly what to do if something should go wrong. Most
   importantly, you have to know exactly how to deal with all the bosses. If
   you don't come prepared for a boss, you will most likely watch the game over
   screen after a short time and that hurts if you've come far. Since you can't
   save, you have to make sure the strategies don't require any luck at all.
   Many of the strategies in this FAQ require luck, but with some adjustments,
   you can use most of them in this challenge. I won't go into details, as you
   should be able to figure it out on your own if you think you're good enough
   to do this challenge. I'll give you a tip, though: Learn Magic Hammer!

   You can also add other restrictions to the ODINS Challenge. Thundaka has
   beaten both NIIENA ODINS and NMIENA ODINS, but those are for true experts
   only. Adding No Materia should be more than enough for regular players.



Q: What's a TAS?

A: TAS stands for Tool Assisted Speed run or Tool Assisted Superplay. You play
   the game on an emulator and use save states for maximum luck manipulation and
   you can slow the game down for perfect execution. Save states allow you to
   save the game anywhere with the push of a button, and you don't lose any time
   doing so. This allows you to do things that are only theoretically possible,
   but a regular human being never could be able to do. For example, you can
   make sure you always get critical hits and that you always escape random
   battles immediately.

   Basically, a TAS is movie making rather than pure gaming, and the result is a
   demonstration of what's theoretically possible. In other words, you're not
   allowed to use any gameshark codes for your advantage, like starting with
   level 99 characters and max stats. Compared to a regular run, a TAS can be
   considered cheating, but the only things you're cheating are luck and time. A
   TAS doesn't require the same amount of skill as a regular speed run, as you
   can just save state before a hard part, but you obviously need to know all
   the strategies in order to get the best result.

Q: We use Tifa to deal major damage in pretty much every battle starting Red
   Dragon. Why is she able to deal so much damage with the Powersoul?

A: Because of the weapon's mechanics. When you check the weapon in the menu, it
   says that it deals more damage when near-death, but she also deals more
   damage if she's under Death Sentence. It works like this:

   Critical (yellow) HP: 2x damage
   Death Sentence: 4x damage
   Deathblow: 2x damage

   Together, that's 16 times normal damage. Deathblow also ignores back row, so
   it's 32 times back row damage. Awesome, huh? And in addition, we equip her
   with armor and accessories to boost her strength. We also use Added Cut
   after the Great Glacier, which allows us to surpass 9999 damage. This is
   what makes Tifa the ultimate killing machine.



Q: What's the "Wait Trick"?

A: First of all, ATB must be at Wait for this to work.

   The Wait Trick abuses the fact that all ATB bars will freeze (both yours
   and the enemies) when you are navigating in any battle sub-menu (e.g. magic,
   item, limit, âselect targetâ). Normally, commands will queue up and be
   executed in the order they were entered. Only after the command has been
   executed that character's (or enemy's) ATB gauge can begin to refill.

   Now, letâs say weâve got these two commands queued (in this order):

   1. Enemy â Attack
   2. Tifa â Deathblow

   While the enemy is executing his Attack have Cloud force a WAIT by entering
   the Item menu, this will freeze all ATB gauges but queued commands will
   still be executed. Normally the enemy's ATB gauge would start to refill once
   he is done with his Attack, but since we are forcing a WAIT it will remain
   empty even during Tifa's Deathblow. When Tifa's Deathblow is over both the
   enemy's and Tifa's ATB gauge will be empty. Now we âremoveâ the forced WAIT
   by simply exiting the Item menu, and as long as Tifa's bar fills quicker
   than enemy's, sheâll get to execute another, second, command before the
   enemy gets to act again.

   The Wait Trick is first used in the Mighty Grunt battle on the 59th floor of
   the Shinra HQ and then in some late disc 2 battles, like The Turks and Proud
   Clod. Check the videos for these battles if you want to see how it works.



Q: What's the deal with the music in the videos? That melody is not from FFVII!

A: Most of the videos are done by lolo26 and he usually adds something else
   than the regular boss or battle music to them. Some melodies are from other
   FF games, some are from animes and he occasionally uses something by The
   Black Mages. Just ask on Youtube if you want to know what melody he uses in
   a certain video.

   In case you don't know, The Black Mages is a band featuring Nobuo Uematsu
   himself on keyboard, that plays heavy metal versions of FF melodies. They
   are really awesome, so I recommend you to check them out.



Q: Why do you call her Aerith? Her name is Aeris!

A: Don't even start. You can call her whatever the hell you want, but I will
   always call her Aerith in my FAQs. Why? Because I'm used to it. I was once
   told that Aeris was a mistranslation and that Aerith was correct, so I
   started calling her that and now I'm used to it. However, I was later told
   that it's not a mistranslation after all and both names apparently are
   correct. But then again, they changed it back to Aerith in Kingdom Hearts
   and that's my argument for still calling her that today, except for being
   used to it. They didn't change it back without a reason. In a Speed Run,
   however, you have to shorten her name to "A" to save a few seconds.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        1.5 <> PAL And NTSC Differences
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The differences between PAL and NTSC cause so much trouble for this challenge
that I decided to give them an own section. I'm not planning to go into details
explaining what PAL and NTSC is, but I can tell you that PAL is the system used
in Europe and NTSC is used in North America and Japan. I believe Australia,
Africa and parts of South America use PAL as well, but I'm not sure. Let me
know if you can confirm this. Anyway, you can just look at your game to find
out what version you have. It says either PAL or NTSC in the upper left corner.

Now let me tell you exactly what causes the trouble. PAL runs on 50 Hz and NTSC
on 60 Hz. I'm not going into details here either, but at least I'll tell you
what causes the trouble. Because of the frequency differences, the PAL version
is 1,2 times slower than the NTSC version. At first we didn't think this was
such a big deal. Alright, so the PAL version is 1,2 times slower. It only means
that PAL gamers spend more time playing than NTSC gamers, but there is no way
you can tell from looking at the clock in the game, as the clock is 1,2 times
slower as well. God, how I wish it was that easy.

Then Bergqvist mentioned something about the FMVs. He found out that the FMVs
are run at the same speed in both PAL and NTSC versions. Now that's a problem.
In the PAL version, FMVs are run at NTSC speed, but the clock is still 1,2
times slower. This is an advantage for PAL gamers, as they will gain the length
of the FMV divided by 1,2. PAL gamers already have a 20 seconds advantage after
the opening FMV because of this. Of course, this isn't fair for NTSC gamers, so
I had to invent the PAL Gamers Penalty, so that PAL and NTSC gamers could be
able to compare their times with each others.

To find out how much the PAL Gamers Penalty was, I had to calculate how much
time the PAL gamers gained from all the FMVs throughout the game. Lolo gave me
a complete list of FMVs and their lenghts so that I could do the calculations
and it turned out to be 5 minutes and 37 seconds. So, when PAL gamers have
beaten the game, they have to add 5 minutes and 37 seconds to their time to be
able to compare their result with NTSC gamers.

That's not all, though. After beating Jenova-SYNTHESIS, you get to open the
menu a last time to check your time, but after that you no longer have a game
clock to tell you the time. You have to use a stopwatch to find out how much
time you spend beating Bizarro, Safer and Sephiroth himself. As I said, the
game isn't considered beaten until Sephiroth himself is defeated. Anyway, NTSC
gamers can simply add the time shown on the stopwatch to their final save time,
but it's not that simple for PAL gamers. Since the game is 1,2 times slower,
they have to divide the time from the stopwatch with 1,2 before they can add it
to the time shown by the game clock after Bizarro.

God, why do different parts of the world have to have different systems? It
makes things so damn complicated. I say the whole world should have used the
NTSC system. It's not fair that the parts of the world that uses PAL must play
games at a 1,2 times slower speed than the rest of the world. Damnit.

It must also be mentioned that people using the Japanese version of the game
have an advantage. As you most likely know, they use these symbols instead of
regular letters and since the amount of symbols is much smaller than the amount
of letters, you will gain time every time there's text to skip. I have no idea
how much, though, but it can't be 'that' much.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            1.6 <> Perfect Run Info
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You think a regular run is too easy? You want to compete with the best and
achieve a best possible time? Or maybe you just want to test your patience? In
any case, a Perfect Run is what you seek.

A Perfect Run is a Speed Run for experts, but it doesn't really require much
more skills than a regular Speed Run. The biggest difference is the amount of
luck and patience needed. In most cases, you can do a few changes in a boss
strategy and save a varied amount of time, but in most cases, these changes
also increase the amount of luck needed drastically.

Since a perfect run has different strategies, you also have to buy different
things and use different setups for battles. This FAQ is written for both
regular and perfect runners, so you will find all the info you need here in
order to complete a Perfect Run. The stuff only perfect runners have to read is
separated with lines of stars.

*******************************************************************************
Like this.
*******************************************************************************

So if you're doing a regular run, you don't have to read this stuff. In boss
strategies, perfect strategies are found at the bottom, below a line of stars.

Just let me warn you before you start a Perfect Run. It requires A LOT of
patience and a lot of time. Although the timer will say 8 hours or less at the
final save, that's only a tiny bit of the time you've spent playing. It takes
at least 100 hours and probably over 200. . If you had patience issues in a
regular run, a Perfect Run is not for you. I won't take any responsibility for
people going insane. You have been warned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


===============================================================================
                            2 - Walkthrough: Midgar
===============================================================================
Some important notes before you start:

Read and understand the walkthrough up to the next save point before you start
playing, so that you know what to do WHEN playing. You can't just leave the
game and check the guide in case you're not sure what to do. Of course, you can
pause the game in battle, so it's not that important in areas with random
encounters or if a boss battle is coming up.

Also, you always have to make sure everyone is alive at the end of battles. If
someone gets killed and doesn't receive EXP, you have no choice but to restart.

And finally, if you use a PS2, make sure Disc Speed is set to Fast and Texture
Mapping is set to Smooth before you start playing. As I said in section 1.3,
these settings reset every time you reset the console.

When you're ready, just select "NEW GAME" and watch the intro FMV.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            2.1 <> The First Mission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before we start playing, we have to do some configurations in the menu. Start
tapping the menu button after Barret tells you to follow him and the menu will
open at the earliest point possible. Depending on what version you have, the
timer will now show you one of the following times:

PC   - 2:17
PAL  - 2:03
NTSC - 2:23

As you can see, you already have a 20 seconds advantage before you even start
playing if you use the PAL version. Since I used the NTSC version for this
run, you'll have no trouble beating my time at the first save point if you use
the PAL version, but logically enough, you have to beat it by more than 20
seconds to actually 'beat' it.

Anyway, enter the "Config" menu and set Cursor to Memory, ATB to Active and all
the speed bars at the fastest. After doing the configurations, just run
straight ahead and the first battle will soon be a fact.


###############################################################################
                                   B01: MP x2
###############################################################################
Just hold the attack button down until the battle is over.

*******************************************************************************
The MPs can attack you either once, twice or three times, depending on how much
your ATB bar is filled when the battle starts. Perfect runners can only accept
one attack, and for that to happen, your ATB bar must be filled more than the
soldiers'. Of course, there's no way you can tell how much the soldiers' bars
are filled, so just hold the attack button down and hope for the best.
###############################################################################


Leave the Platform through the open door and head over to the members of
Avalanche. Talking will start automatically.

[skip text]

This includes naming Cloud and Barret. As I said in the intro, you have to
shorten the names to one digit in order to save time. Just tap X until there's
one letter left and then push start and the action button. Holding X is faster,
but make sure not to hold it too long, to avoid erasing all the letters. Cloud
will automatically move on to the next area when the talking is over.

Make your way to the reactor. You'll get your first random encounter on the
bridges, most likely by the junction, but of course, it all depends on how fast
you are. In the next area, just head over to the crew and talking will start.

[skip text]

Talk to Biggs to open the first door and Jessie to open the second door and the
elevator. Quickly push the button inside the elevator to move down. If you're
fast enough, you can push the button and get the message "switch on" before
Jessie tells you to push it.

[skip text]

Run out of the elevator and follow Jessie down the stairs. You can pass her if
you're fast enough, but she'll be in front of you again in the next area either
way. Here, follow her and talk to her before jumping on the ladder. Then move
on until you reach the bottom, but don't pick up the Potion now, as you have to
pick it up on the way back up anyway.

*******************************************************************************
If you're too fast, saving before Guard Scorpion won't make the next battle
disappear. This happened to lolo in his test run, but we couldn't understand
why. Then it happened to me as well, and I knew there could only be one reason.
We were being too fast. Your third random encounter will come on the pipe over
the save point, and if you've paid attention, you'll know that it says "M-3"
where it curves. If you get the battle after the "3", the saving trick won't
work, so if that happens, you have to make sure to "waste" some time before
saving. Don't run straight to the save point after descending the ladder, but
run along the fence instead. That did the trick for me. Even though we only
lose two seconds at most, I find this damn annoying. It's just ridiculous.

This is the first time we save to avoid a random encounter, so don't forget to
soft-reset and load up before you continue on.

*******************************************************************************
The perfect strategy against Guard Scorpion won't work if your magic stat is
too low. I'm not sure how high it should be, but you must be able to deal at
least 90 damage on average.

Pick up the Restore Materia in the next area and move on a little bit further

It's time to fight the first boss, the almighty Guard Scorpion. Big surprise.


###############################################################################
                              B02: Guard Scorpion
###############################################################################
You need both Cloud and Barret to have a limit break after this battle, to make
sure the battle with Air Buster gets as short as possible. Don't worry, I've
made a strategy for you, but for this strategy to work, Cloud must get a limit
break before GS raises the tail. If you're lucky, one Scorpion Tail is enough,
but you'll most likely have to take two attacks. In case you don't know, GS
will use Search Scope on a character and then attack the target with either
Rifle or Scorpion Tail, and he will do this twice before he raises the tail.
You will most likely have to restart a couple of times, but it doesn't matter,
as you just saved anyway.

Cloud and Barret will have four turns each before GS raises his tail. Have
Cloud cast Bolt and Barret attack regularly, in that order, and make sure to
use Cloud's limit break at once when he gets it. Yes, by taking advantage of
the limit break system so that he uses it before it's GS's turn again.

When GS raises his tail, have Barret defend and Cloud cast Bolt. Guess what GS
does. Now comes the most important part. Have Cloud cast Bolt again and have
Barret select the attack command, but don't attack just yet. Just make sure
he's aiming at GS until he lowers the tail again. Barret will get a limit break
now, but since you selected the attack command before he got it, he will only
attack regulary when you push the action button. Well, when GS lowers his tail,
have Barret attack and Cloud cast Bolt again and Guard Scorpion's days will be
over for this time.

A few notes:

* If Barret's ATB bar is almost full when the battle start, have him attack.
  If he gets a shot at GS before he uses Search Scope, you will get an easier
  battle, as Barret won't have to attack after GS lowers the tail again.

* You may not be able to defeat him after Cloud's last Bolt if your stats are
  too low. Yes, your stats will vary from time to time when you start a new
  game, and it also varies how much they increase at level up. Example: Cloud
  once did 84-88 damage with Bolt, but another time he did 92-96. I suggest
  restarting from the beginning if your stats are too low.

* If GS attacks both Cloud and Barret with Scorpion tail, they might both get
  limit breaks before he raises the tail. Sure, you can use both, but then you
  have to let Barret attack twice when the tail is raised as you'll kill him
  too early if you use Bolt. If Barret got to attack before GS's first turn,
  and both Cloud and Barret get to use their limit breaks before the tail is
  raised, you will kill him too early either way.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners only need Cloud to have a limit break after the battle. Make
sure Barret gets to use a limit break before the tail is raised and then have
him defend. Now have Cloud cast Bolt once and GS will do what he usually does
when the tail is raised. Then have Cloud cast Bolt and Barret attack again. If
your stats are high enough, he will be dead now. Cloud's magic stat must be at
least 25 for this strategy to work.

If it's lower, you can need either Cloud or Barret to get an attack in before
GS uses his first Search Scope. Logically enough, you'll lose a couple of
seconds because you need an extra attack.

Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5RjhvRZPco

A quicker, but more luck requiring strategy is to make sure Barret gets to use
two limit breaks. For this strategy to work, GS must use Scorpion Tail on him
twice. On the fourth turn, wait until you know what attack he will use until
you select Cloud's action. If he uses Scorpion Tail, you can have him attack
regularly instead of casting Bolt for the next two turns. Since the animation
for the Bolt spell is much longer than that of a regular attack, you'll save a
few seconds. However, the damage dealt by the second Scorpion Tail and Tail
Laser might not be enough to fill up Barret's limit bar. If it doesn't, you can
just hit the reset button. Since you already had Cloud attack regularly twice,
there's no way you can beat GS in time without another limit break by Barret.
If Cloud's magic is 25 or 26, Barret must attack regularly four times during
the battle. If it's lower, he must attack five times.

If Cloud's magic is 26 and Barret's strength 21, which both are the highest
possible, you can defeat him after Cloud's last Bolt. But if you already have
these stats, there's a strategy that's around 30 seconds faster! Of course,
this strategy requires too much luck. It goes like this: First of all, you need
one or both of the characters to get in an attack before the first Search
Scope. If you only get in one, you need one of Barret's attacks to go critical.
Then, you need GS to attack both Cloud and Barret and Barret must get a limit
break. And here comes the best part: This limit break must go critical! Yeah,
that's very likely to happen. Here's a video of a successful attempt, recorded
by BrutalAl: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrLulxPm4Tg

Cloud's magic stat must be 26 for this battle to work, but you don't need
perfect strength stats. I'm not sure what the minimum required amount is. If
you manage to pull this off, you should save after the battle. You still save
around 20 seconds, something you easily can lose on the long way to the next
save point.
*******************************************************************************

Wow, I wrote that much about Guard Scorpion? Damn...

It's time to head back and make sure you hurry cause you only have ten minutes!
Well, if you're fast enough, you can make it with more than eight minutes left
on the timer. Make sure to pick up the Potion and talk to Jessie on your way
up, or else you won't get anywhere. After riding the elevator, talk to Jessie
to open the first door and Biggs to open the second. When you leave this area,
the game will run automatically until you get to control Cloud in Sector 8.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                2.2 <> Aftermath
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Climb the stairs to enter the next area. Cloud will go talk to a certain girl
here, but unfortunately, we have to disappoint her by not buying a flower this
time. You can't be nice all the time, eh? Of course, the main reason is that
you save time.

[skip text]

Follow her to the next area and continue on until you encounter the MPs. Don't
bother picking up the Potion, as you really don't need it. Needless to say, you
don't have time to fight the MPs, so make sure to choose "later", which is the
second option. You have to do this three times before Cloud jumps on the train.

[skip text]

Inside the train, you get to control Cloud again after Jessie cleans his face.
Just follow the others to the next car.

[skip text]

Go talk to Jessie when you get to control Cloud again.

*******************************************************************************
This can be a little tricky. Jessie is standing between Wedge and the entrance
to the next car. If you run too far, Cloud will attempt to enter the next car,
and then the conductor will come running, telling you that you're bothering the
other passengers. However, if you don't run far enough, you might talk to Wedge
instead of Jessie. I really hate this part, and I don't know how many times
I've screwed up here, but I guess all I can say for advise is to pratice it.
*******************************************************************************

[skip text]

Approach Barret and talking will start automatically.

[skip text]

The train will arrive at the station in Sector 7 after the FMV and you get to
control Cloud after he jumps out of the train. Just run down to the others.

[skip text]

I recommend you to save here if this is your first Speed Run, since it's a long
time until the next "mandatory" save. Then enter town and talk to Barret when
all the others have entered the 7th Heaven. Tifa is the last one to enter, and
there's no point talking to him before she's inside. 

[skip text]

You have to name Tifa during this one. Don't forget to shorten her name. This
is the last time I say this, so you're on your own from now on. Head back to
the door after talking and Barret will come running.

[skip text]

Take the elevator down to the hideout and approach Barret.

[skip text]

Start moving back and Tifa will come.

[skip text]

Then take the elevator upstairs and move just ahead towards the exit. Tifa will
soon come up for some talking. This includes the flashback and Barret giving
you the money.

[skip text]

After sleeping, Cloud will wake up in the basement. Head back up and talk to
Barret. You have to be careful now, because Barret will ask you to give him a
materia tutorial, and you have to select the bottom alternative to prevent
that. This is what Barret says:

"Our next target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first. I'll
fill you in on the train. Yo! Cloud! Before the next mission, I got somethin' I
wanna ask you! I, uh, ......I don't really know how to use Materia! I'll give
you that Materia you found. Just teach me how to use it!"

Then you get to select options and make sure you select the bottom one. Leave
town and enter the train when you get to control Cloud again.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                           2.3 <> The Second Mission
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[skip text]

You get to control Cloud again after Tifa tells you to come over and look at
the monitor. Just run over to her and talking will start automatically.

[skip text]

The alarm goes off, and it's time to escape. If you're fast enough, you can
leave this car before the timer shows up at all.

[skip text]

We're leaving the train now, but since we have 15 seconds to spend, we might as
well take the opportunity to equip Barret with his Assault Gun. We don't lose
any time doing this, as the timer still runs when using the menu, and we have
to wait for it to reach 0 anyway. Talk to the man standing on the left side
afterwards and choose the first option to receive a Hi-Potion. Then wait until
the timer reaches zero.

[ship text]

Now, attempt to enter the next car and you'll be forced to jump off the train.

[ship text]

Start heading north, and make sure to run close to the wall on the right side
to save time. After four screens, you'll reach the security sensors and you'll
have one line of text to skip. Then find the entrance to the duct on the left
side and select the second option to enter.

Inside, pick up the Ether and keep moving on until you reach the plate area.
Here, climb up the first ladder, crawl through the shaft and climb down the
ladder on the left side in the area with Jessie. Then continue on until you
reach the bottom of the reactor.

[skip text]

Plant the bomb and head back to the save point. This save will also make the
next random encounter go away, so don't forget to load up after saving.


[SAVE YOUR GAME]
My time:         31:16
Rec. time (10h): 34:52
Rec. time (12h): 41:50


Head back up after saving. You know where to go. Pick up the Ether after riding
the elevator and enter the room to the left for the lovely panel challenge.

You will lose plenty of time here if you keep screwing up, so you should do
some practice first. My trick is to count quickly to five, but this is
something you have to figure out on your own. I can tell you that Barret and
Tifa push the panels 1,5 seconds after you skip the line of text. It's actually
very easy when you get a hang of it, but it's up to you to decide how many
attempts to accept. You lose around 6-7 seconds for each attempt. BTW, how come
Barret and Tifa always push the panels at the same time? Are they able to read
each others minds or something?

Saving here won't make the next encounter go away, but if you had a really hard
time with the panels, then you're free to save. Then just continue on until the
soldiers show up on the bridges.

[skip text]

The President will, as usual, send Air Buster on you.


###############################################################################
                                B03: Air Buster
###############################################################################
Just hold the attack button down and Barret, Cloud and Tifa will attack in that
order. Unless you have bad luck with the damage dealt by the limit breaks, the
battle will be over after Tifa's attack. Just have Cloud attack one more time
if that happens. Easiest battle so far.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners need Cloud's limit break to go critical, so that the battle
gets as short as possible. I have no idea what the chance for that to happen
is, but I have gotten critical limit breaks more often in this battle than any
other battles. Once, both Cloud and Barret's limit break went critical in the
same battle. Just hold the action button and Barret will open with a regular
attack. Air Buster will counter and then Cloud will kill him with his limit
break if it goes critical. That is, if his strength is high enough. If it's too
low, you must have Tifa attack as well. If the limit break doesn't go critical,
you know what to do.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After the explosion, Cloud falls down to the slums and the screen goes black.

[skip text]

You get to control Cloud after a while. Just talk to Aerith. She's standing to
the right of Cloud now.

[skip text]

Talk to her again. Now, she's standing in front of Cloud. This time, you also
have to name her.

[skip text]

After a while, Reno and his men will show up. Approach them and Aerith will say
one line. Then go back and talk to her.

[skip text]

You get to control Cloud again in the back room, and it's time to escape the
church. Just move on. Talking will start automatically when you reach the gap.

[skip text]

Aerith will fall and the soldiers will attack. Tell her "RUN" the first time,
which is the third and bottom option. Then head up to the barrel on the top of
the screen, or at twelve o'clock if you want, and wait there until the second
soldier attacks. Tell her "hold on" this time and then push the barrel. Tell
her "RUN" again when the last soldier attacks and just wait until she reaches
the top and the screen changes to another view. You'll have one line to skip
here before the screen changes again. Then you get to control Cloud again, and
you're free to leave the church.

[skip text]

Control Cloud through the scrap area by tapping the left direction button.
Aerith will fall behind and you have to wait for her.

[skip text]

Continue running to the left and you'll end up on the streets.

[skip text]

Just head for town and Aerith's house and pick up the items in Aerith's garden.
It's an Ether and a Cover Materia, to be more precise. Talking will start
automatically when you enter the house.

[skip text]

Run upstairs.

[skip text]

Time to leave. Cloud will walk automatically out of the bedroom, and if you
push the action buttom when passing by the bag, you will be able to pick up the
Potion and Phoenix Down when he's walking, thus not losing time picking them
up. Then walk slowly downstairs and make sure to stay away from Aerith's door,
or she'll bust you. When you get out, it's time to save. Don't forget to load
the file before you move on.

Before we leave for the Wall Market, it's time to do some shopping. Enter the
caravan and talk to the woman to the right.


Sell: Everything in your inventory!
Buy: 68 Grenades.


You can't spend all the money on Grenades because you need 280 Gil to buy
various stuff at the Wall Market. Leave town when you're done shopping and
Aerith will be waiting for you outside the gate to Sector 6. Just approach her
to trigger the cutscenes.

Just get through this area as fast as possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alright, we're gonna have Corneo choose Cloud as his date for tonight. To make
that happen, we have to get a few more items than usual and many things have to
be done in order to get them. But why are we having Corneo choose Cloud, you
may ask. Don't we lose a lot of time getting all the extra items? The answer is
no. If Cloud is chosen, you're taken directly to Corneo's room, but if one of
the girls are chosen, you have to fight Corneo's Lackeys and that takes a
while. Lolo tested both options and found out that it's 30 seconds faster when
Cloud gets chosen.

You'll have one line to skip before you get to control Cloud. To make this
easier, I'll make a list with all the things to do, point for point with
numbers. There will be one or more lines of text to skip at the end of each
step. Don't screw this up now.


1. Go ask the fat man in front of the Honeybee Inn about Tifa. That's the first
   option, so just skip the text until he's done talking.

2. Go talk to the guy outside Corneo's mansion.

3. Enter the Boutique (clothing store) and talk to the girl behind the desk.

4. Enter the Materia Shop and talk to the man. Just skip the text and you'll
   agree to do the favour.

5. Eat at the restaurant and tell them the food was all right. It's the second
   option. You'll receive a Pharmacy Coupon. It doesn't matter what you eat.

6. Enter the Pharmacy and exchange the coupon for the Digestive, which is the
   third and bottom option.

7. Sleep at the Inn and buy the drink for 200 Gil. That's the second option.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners should save now, as this is the last time you pass by the save
point. Saving after dressing up as Miss Cloud will cost you 6-7 seconds.
*******************************************************************************

8. Enter the Materia Shop again and talk to the man. He'll give you the Diamond
   Tiara for doing the favour.

9. Enter the Bar and give the Digestive to the girl at the toilet. She'll grant
   you the Sexy Cologne.

10. Talk to the owner of the Boutique and select the second option both times
    when he asks what kind of dress you want.

11. Head back to the Boutique and talk to the owner behind the desk.

12. Enter the Gym and beat Big Bro in the squat contest. Select the second
    option twice when talking. The price you get for winning the contest is the
    Blonde Wig.

13. Head back to the Boutique again and enter the changing room. Cloud will now
    change into Miss Cloud.

Time to go pay a visit to Don Corneo. Talk to the man outside to enter.

[skip text]

Go upstairs and then downstairs to the basement to find Tifa. Approaching her
will trigger the cutscenes.

[skip text]

Talk to Tifa.

[skip text]

Pick up the Ether, head back up and enter Corneo's office. Run ahead and to
the right to trigger just by his desk the cutscenes.

[skip text]

Cloud will be chosen and you'll be taken directly to Corneo's back room for
some quality time. You'll have one line to skip before you can go talk to him,
but make sure to pick up the Hyper behind his bed first. Select the second
option twice to get things over with as soon as possible.

[skip text]

Head over to the girls when you get to control Cloud again.

[skip text]

Talk to Aerith and Tifa in that order. Aps will soon appear.


###############################################################################
                                    B04: Aps
###############################################################################
Have the girls throw Grenades and Cloud cast Bolt in that order. Then have
everyone throw Grenades until the battle is over. Don't use any limit breaks.
Using the girls' limit breaks is a waste of time, and you have to save Cloud's
for later. Aps will use Sewer Tsunami three times with this strategy, but if
you're lucky and manage to throw a Grenade before he uses the first Tsunami, he
will only use the attack twice.

If you open the battle with three Grenades and then use Bolt on the next turn,
he will only use Sewer Tsunami twice. You can also have Cloud attack instead of
using Bolt, but then the attack must go critical. This strategy is faster than
the regular three Tsunami battle as long as he uses Tail Attack and not Lick
on the turn between the two Tsunamis. However, if you manage to throw a Grenade
before his first Tsunami, the original strategy is faster again, so needless to
say, perfect runners have to get a Grenade in before the first Tsunami.

###############################################################################
First have Cloud attack regularly and then throw Grenades until the battle is
over. Yes, Reno will open the battle by trapping one of the characters inside a
Pyramid, but just let the remaining characters take care of him. You will
actually lose time if you take out the Pyramid to free the trapped character.
If Cloud gets trapped and didn't get to attack first, just have Barret attack
instead on the next turn. The same goes if Cloud already has a limit break when
the battle begins. If both Cloud and Barret have limit breaks, you must have
Tifa attack. As long as you only use 7 Grenades, it doesn't matter.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners must have Tifa get trapped inside the Pyramid and you should
also make sure Cloud gets attacked all the time. That way, your party will have
as much HP as possible before the Shinra HQ. Cloud automatically gets healed
after the battle, so it doesn't matter if he loses HP. Needless to say, this
requires some luck, but hey, you just saved at the bottom of the pillar. Also,
take note that Electro-mag Rod might paralyze you and make you lose time.
Restart if that happens.

You can control Cloud during this cutscene. Place him just in front of Barret.
Talk to him once the cutscene is over (or at least try to) and he'll find the

Cloud will go on alone to the next area. Just move on and the others will soon

Head back to Aerith's house and listen to Elmyra's story. Just enter the house

Approach the door and Barret will come running down.

[skip text]

We're going back to the Wall Market again. You know how to get there. If you
aren't comfortable with the climbing, you should save when you get there and
then do some practice. Especially practice jumping on that swinging pole, as
you lose more than 10 seconds if you miss it. It makes a noise just before you
have to jump. Knowing that should make it easier. If you don't save, and keep
missing it, you'll end up losing a lot more time than the ~13 seconds you would
have lost if you saved. Also, remember that you only have to use two batteries.

Anyway, enter the Weapon Shop and talk to the man to the left. Just skip the
text and you'll buy the Batteries. Then follow the kids to the next area and
approach the wire.

[skip text]

What can I say? Just get through here as fast as possible. When you reach the

Regular players can take the stairs, but perfect runners have to go in through
the main entrance and take the elevator. If you take the stairs, you should
pick up the Elixir in the fifth area. Also, the party will stop for some
talking in the sixth area and when you reach the top. At the top, Cloud will
automatically move on to the next area after talking.

*******************************************************************************
Depending on how many times you have to stop the elevator and how many times
you run into the Shinra guy, it can be up to 145 seconds faster than the
stairs. Unfortunately, the chance of getting the best outcome is only 1/1845. A
perfect runner should restart until he gets that outcome, but even if you are
lucky and get it, you still have a long way to go before you reach the next
save point and there are many things that can go wrong on the way there. First,
we have the Mighty Grunt battle, where the outcome varies from time to time,
depending on how many times the enemies get to attack. You also have to go
through several random battles on floor 65, and you already know that the
number of times you get attacked before you're able to escape varies. And on
top of everything, you might get nervous and do mistakes. The guards on floor
60 can be mentioned here. Sure, you can practice that part until you can do it
with your eyes closed, but if you just got a 1/1845 outcome in the elevator,
there's a chance you'll be a little nervous. I know I would be. In other words,
you might end up losing all the time you gained from the best outcome, and if
you already got the best outcome, there's no chance in hell you'll get it
again. No one is that lucky.

Thankfully, there are many other outcomes that are faster than the stairs, and
the chance you'll get one of these is around 1/5. That's not bad at all. You'll
face much worse odds later. These outcomes are faster than the stairs:

- 1 battle and 3/4 shinra employees
- 2 battles and 1/2/3/4 shinra employees
- 3 battles and 0/1 shinra employee

The best outcome is one battle and three shinra employees.

After entering the building, you'll have some text to skip and then a forced
battle with some Grenade Combatants. Here's how to take care of the enemies:

Moth Slasher: Grenade + Bolt or Bolt + Beat Rush
Hammer Blaster: Grenade + Bolt, Tifa attack + Bolt or Beat Rush + Bolt
Sword Dance: Grenade + attack, Grenade + Beat Rush
Grenade Combatant: Grenade
Mighty Grunt: 2x Grenade

You can also use Cloud's limit breaks instead of Grenades. Make sure to use it
as soon as possible. You can also use the Wait Trick (described in the FAQ
section (1.4) and in the Mighty Grunt battle below) to "remove" an enemy attack
and thus save time.

Note: You can't use more than 9 Grenades in total before you reach floor 59.

Note 2: Before doing anything, you should play ahead and see if you get a
random encounter after the Mighty Grunts battle on floor 59. If you do, you
won't be able to escape it and that's bad for several reasons. You can only
encounter Mighty Grunts on floor 59, and since they're harder to deal with than
the other enemies, you should run around on floor 1 and make sure you get the
battle there instead. You can't escape that one either, but at least you'll
have easier enemies to deal with.

                                   ##########

Run straight ahead and the three Mighty Grunts will attack. There's one line to
skip before the battle starts.

We're going to use the Wait Trick in this battle. Have the first two characters
who get a turn throw Grenades at different targets and have the last character
select a Grenade and move the cursor to the enemy the others didn't attack.
Wait until you see the damage from the second Grenade before you confirm. Then
simply hold the action button until the battle is over.

Note: You should practice the Wait Trick before you attempt this battle for
real. You don't want to screw up here if you just had a great outcome in the
elevator. Once you get the hang of it, it's really simple.

Note: Make sure to set ATB back to Active before floor 65.

[skip text]

Enter the elevator to the right after picking up the keycard and push the
action button by the panel inside. Select floor 60, which is the third option.
Then talk to Barret and Tifa to proceed.



                                    Floor 60
                                   ##########

After a short cutscene, you get to control Cloud from a kinda strange view.
Hold the direction up and right buttons down to exit this screen. Doing that
will bring you closer to the room on the left side when you get the regular
view of this floor. You save an entire second by doing this. Anyway, just enter
the room and there will be some talking. Cloud will automatically move outside
afterwards.

[skip text]

You know how this works. If you're spotted by the guards, you have to fight two
Mighty Grunts, attacking from both sides. You don't want that to happen. The
left side is easy, as the guards are only walking. You really suck if you get
spotted here. The right side, however, can be tricky even for experts, as the
guards are running and you have to act quickly when they start moving. To make
it easier, you should wait until there is no guard in front of the first open
area. Then you can simply start running when the guards start heading for the
other side. And by doing that, there will be no guard in front of the last open
area when you get there, but there will always be a guard in the middle. You
should really practice this if you aren't comfortable with it.

*******************************************************************************
If you're fast enough, you can cross the first area without stopping at all
with Cloud and only take one break with Barret and Tifa. Then you only have to
stop once with Cloud and Barret on the other side, but Tifa must stop twice.
This is something you really have to practice for the major run.

Proceed to the next floor. The man that will give you the keycard to floor 62
is walking around in the room, and you'll find him to the left of the elevator
when you enter the floor. Talk to him and select the second option to receive
the keycard. Then proceed to the next floor. Use the stairs.

Great news! BrutalAl discovered a quick way to find out what the password is!
These are his words:

So, after having mapped every shelf for every password, luck would have it that
one out of all those 24 shelves actually did have a unique title for each
password, and the lost time for reading it is only 4,5 seconds! The Magic Shelf
is in the 'Space Dev. Research Library' (Green Shelfs, Blue floor). It's on the
left side of the middle bookshelf and the magic titles are as follows:

BEST - 2 Economic report: Space Dev Program
KING - 1 Results of failed space mission "YA-79"
BOMB - 1 Breakdown of SOLDIER members by class
MAKO - 10 New plans for urban planning

If the password is MAKO you'll probably lose another second just because you
have to move the marker all that way to the bottom in Dominos guess-list, but
that's it =)

Of course, we lose 4,5 seconds compared to just guessing the password, but we
need the Elemental materia, and this section is hard enough as it is. Take the
elevator up to floor 65 when you're done.



                                    Floor 65
                                   ##########

Yes, that's the floor with the Midgar Parts. The first chest will always be the
same, but after that, the next chest that will open depends on where you place
the parts. Place the first part just to the right of the entrance, or at five
o'clock if you want and then continue counter-clockwise around. By doing that,
the chests will open in the order shown by this excellent ASCII art:

--------------------------------------
|                            |       |
|                            |  [5]  |

Make sure to go left to reach the fifth chest. It's a little bit faster than
going right. After placing the fifth and last part, the chest containing the
keycard to floor 66 will open up and you can proceed to the next floor.



                                    Floor 66
                                   ##########

Run down the hall and enter the toilet. Choose to climb up, which is the second
option and crawl down the shaft to do a little spying on the Shinra.

Head back down and move on to floor 67. Cloud will stop at the corner, and you
have to wait until Hojo leaves the floor before you can move on.

Move on, pick up the Poison Materia from the chest and save. If Cloud or Tifa's

You could just throw eight Grenades at him and the battle would be over, but
I'm afraid it's not that simple. First of all, you need Cloud's limit bar to be
at least half full after the battle. Ideally, it should be full, but that's
very hard to accomplish. But that's not all. The number of times the small guys
attack varies from time to time and logically enough, the more they attack, the
more time you lose. You also want to avoid him using Shady Breath twice. Well,
it's all up to you, so keep restarting until you get a satisfying result.
Needless to say, perfect runners have no choice.

Note: If Cloud doesn't have a limit break now, you have to make sure he gets it
before Rufus. Also, if Cloud's HP is very low and you get into a battle before
you reach the elevator on floor 66, he might die. I recommend doing a test run
first, to find out if you get a battle on the way to the elevator. If you do,
and Cloud's HP is low, you should save on floor 67 just after the battle.

Pick up the Enemy Skill Materia and leave this screen to the right, the way you
came from. Then take the elevator back down to floor 67 and then continue down
to floor 66 and enter the elevator there. As usual, Rude will come an bust you.

You'll wake up in a cell on floor 67. Approach the door and select the third
option to wonder what Aerith is doing. Then, before the talking starts, place
Cloud just by Tifa's head. You have to approach the door again from a certain
distance when the scene is over, or you won't trigger the option box.

Approach the door again and choose to get some sleep now. It's the third
option, but the cursor will be at this option either way, so you just have to
tap the action button.

Okay, I think I'll explain this step-by-step this time, to make it easier. As
usual, there will be one or more lines of text to skip at the end of each step.


1. When you wake up, the door will be open. Approach the door and Cloud will
   wonder what's happened.

2. Go examine the guard.

3. Head back to tell Tifa.

4. Tifa will run out to the guard. Follow her and talk to her.

5. Go talk to Barret and Red.

6. Now, they will go examine the guard. Follow them and talk to Barret.

7. Go talk to the girls. A party of Cloud and the girls will be formed.

two battles.


###############################################################################
                              B08: Hundred Gunner
###############################################################################
Just throw Grenades until the battle is over. All limit breaks must be saved
for Heli. It's important that Aerith isn't the one dealing the final blow to
Hundred, or else Heli will most likely be able to attack between the two
Grenades and the limit breaks, so that you won't be able to take advantage of
the limit break system. To prevent that from happening, you simply have to make
sure she throws the first or second Grenade, as the character that throws the
third one will be the one that deals the final blow.

HG will attack twice with Aux/Hidden Artillery and once with Main Artillery,
but he won't live long enough to use Wave Artillery. If both of the Aux/Hidden
Artilleries hit the same character (with the exception of Aerith), you should
restart. We're not supposed to heal in these battles, and the target will most
likely die against Heli if that happens. Aerith's in back row, so hope he
attacks her at least once.

###############################################################################
                                B09: Heli Gunner
###############################################################################
This battle is harder because Heli's attacks can inflict statuses. AB Cannon
can put a character to sleep, C Cannon can poison you and Firing Line, which
hits the whole party, can inflict both. Thankfully, you don't get the statuses
very often. If you get poisoned, there's really nothing you can do about it, so
just keep fighting and hope it doesn't kill you. It's much worse if a character
is put to sleep, as you may not be able to kill him before he kills one of your
characters. Still, you can just keep fighting and see what happens. If you're
lucky, he attacks the same character again so that he wakes up. You lose time
either way, though, so perfect runners cannot accept being put to sleep.

Strategy: Throw two Grenades, use Barret and Red's limit breaks and throw three
more Grenades. That should take care of him, but there's a chance he still has
a few more HP left. If that's the case, then have Barret attack regularly. Red
is allowed to get killed in this battle.

*******************************************************************************
If you have 18 or more Grenades, there is a faster strategy you can use. On the
first turn, have Aerith and Red throw Grenades and Barret use his limit break.
Then have Barret attack regularly and the others throw Grenades. Now, you need
two more Grenades to kill him. For this strategy to work, Heli cannot put
anyone to sleep with his AB Cannon, or else he will be able to attack more than
three times and the strategy will be slower again.

After the battle, the scene will change to Cloud and you're given the choice to
remove materia from the others and open the menu. Now why would we want to do
that? Just push the start button.

###############################################################################
                                   B10: Rufus
###############################################################################
Start the battle by using Braver on Dark Nation. If Rufus opens the battle with
his shotgun, you need to select the limit break quickly, or Dark Nation might
get a turn too and you will lose five seconds. Killing Dark Nation is faster
because you don't have to watch his attacks every turn, but it also reduces the
chance of dying to zero. Two Bolts and the battle would have been over. When
he's gone, throw four Grenades at Rufus to end the battle. You will get another
limit break, but it must be saved for Motor Ball.

Note: There is a small chance you won't deal enough damage to kill Dark Nation
with Braver. He's got 140 HP. If Cloud's Strentgh is 22, Cloud will deal about
134 to 142 damage, so then you need some luck. If it's 21, you won't be able to
deal 140 at all. In that case, you can simply attack him on the next turn if
you don't mind lose ~10 seconds, but if you do, you're gonna have to redo the
last segment and hope you get a higher strength gain when you defeat HO512.

*******************************************************************************
You should have at least 12 Grenades at the start of the battle, but if you
only have 11, you have to kill him with three Grenades and Bolt. Also, Rufus
should open the battle with his shotgun. If Dark Nation opens the battle, you
lose about two seconds.

                                  ############

Head back down to floor 69 and talk to Tifa. I would recommend saving here if
you're not comfortable with the motorcycle game. After talking to Tifa, the
scene will then change to Aerith on the first floor. Head for the exit to
trigger the cutscenes.

[skip text]

Before the motorcycle game starts, you get the chance to form a party and open
the menu, but just push the start button again. During the minigame, just make
sure Cloud, Barret and Tifa don't take too much damage. Aerith and Red don't
matter. I'm not an expert at this game, and you might do a lot better than me.
If you truly suck at it and lose too much HP, you can use BrutalAl's strategy,
as explained below.

I often go with a lame but effective tactic in this mini-game:
1) Swing your sword at all time
2) Never kill a red bike
3) Stay close to the car
Since the red bikes "dodge" your sword they will stay away from you at all
time, and if you are close to the car then they will stay away from the car as
well. Once there are 3 red bikes on screen you're home safe.

###############################################################################
                                B11: Motor Ball
###############################################################################
Thanks to the back attack, you'll be in back row for this battle. Open the
battle by having Cloud cast Bolt and let the others follow up with Grenades.
Make sure Bolt always is the first move every turn. Use Cloud and Barret's
limit breaks as soon as they get them and make sure to take advantage of the
limit break system. Don't use Tifa's limit break. Keep casting Bolt and
throwing Grenades, and it could be over after Cloud's fifth Bolt. If it isn't,
throw another grenade, or, if you have none left, use a regular attack from
Barret, and hope it kills him.

It mostly depends on Cloud's magic stat whether you'll be able to kill him or
not. You don't have time to check his stats, so you have to pay attention to
the damage. If he deals less than 220, you're in trouble. That is, unless you
have an extra Grenade.

*******************************************************************************
In the beginning of the battle, he will use Arm Attack twice and he's able to
use this attack twice in one turn. Perfect runners should restart if he uses it
more than twice in total.

doesn't matter if you run a few inches in the wrong direction now, though.
Sephiroth walks slowly in front of you and you can't pass him until after the

Load up before you move on, or else it won't work. Then run for another ten
seconds before you save again. If you want to save 13 seconds, you can restart
until you reach the marches without getting an encounter.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners can only save once between Kalm and the Mythril Mines. It's
possible to get only one encounter between Kalm and the marches and it's
possible to cross the marches without running into the Midgar Zolom, so you
cannot accept more than one save.

Since the pattern of enemies can vary from time to time, you'll never know when
you get the first battle after Kalm. If you're lucky and get the best pattern,
you can almost reach the marches, but you can of course get the worst pattern
too. Gambling is not a good idea since you just did the flashback in Kalm, so I
recommend saving after ten seconds.

You need some luck to both reach the marches without being attacked and cross
the marches without running into the Midgar Zolom, so you will most likely have
to restart many times before you succeed. You just saved, though, so it's not
that bad. Just imagine if you had to do the flashback every time...
*******************************************************************************

Okay, we're gonna use the save trick to cross the marches as well. Here's how
it works: Start running into the marches and make sure to pay attention. You
have to push the menu button as soon as the Midgar Zolom appears on the screen.
If he gets too close, he will get you, even if you already pushed the button.
Just give it a try and see for yourself what happens. Anyway, save your game if
you successfully managed to open the menu and then exit the menu again. Now,
the battle will start immediately, but you can just escape and then soft-reset.
When you load the file now, the Midgar Zolom will be at a different location
and you can safely continue over to the other side.

Just be aware that you may have to save again if he appears too close to you.
It depends on how far you got into the marches before you saved. Some times, he
appears only a couple of seconds after you set your foot in the swamp, but you
can also be lucky and reach the other side. It depends on his location when you
start crossing. If he appears too early, you will encounter him again, so that
you have to save twice. If you get about halfway through, it'll work, so make
sure you get that far if you don't want to save twice.

When you safely reach the other side, the screen will automatically change to
the screen with the killed serpent. Cloud will run ahead, and you'll have one
line of text to skip before you get to control him. Just run left to exit this
screen and hold the direction down and right buttons when the screen turns
black. By doing that, you will hardly see the world map again before you're
inside the mine. Here, just run left and enter the next area where you meet
some old friends.

[skip text]

Climb up and leave the mines. Back on the world map, run for about ten seconds
again before you stop. For the first time since the train lockdown, you have to
do some changes in the menu.

Cloud: Give him Poison and Steal
Tifa: Equip the Mythril Armlet and give her Restore=All and Enemy Skill

When you enter town, there will be a short cutscene and you'll have one box of

Grenades. Enter the shop to the right and buy so that you have 36 Grenades. If
you don't have enough money, you must sell the Talisman first. Then you'll have
more than enough. Head down to the beach after shopping. Things will happen

###############################################################################
                                B12: Bottomswell
###############################################################################
Open the battle by having Cloud cast Bio and the others throw Grenades, in that
order. Restart if you fail to poison him. If you manage to poison him, you can
have everyone throw Grenades, but make sure Tifa acts first. That's very
important, as you have to activate her limit break when the third Grenade is
thrown. Make sure you get a "yeah". Now, Bottomswell will use Waterpolo, but
that's nothing to worry about. All you have to do now is to throw four more
Grenades and the battle will be over. That is, after Big Wave.

Note: If Bottomswell uses Waterpolo on a character that has been attacked twice
by Tail Attack or taken a critical hit, there's a chance this character won't
survive Big Wave. Bottomswell will only use Tail Attack twice, so the chance
for that to happen isn't very high.

It's time for marching and you have to get a higher score than 50%. Your reward
for that will be 5000 Gil and trust me, you really need the money. I know there
are many people out there who can't handle the marching, but I have come up
with a strategy that can't fail, unless you screw up somehow.


Many people screw this up because they do like the other soldiers and run to
the back to reach the open spot. Well, you can't do that. Instead you must run
straight ahead, "through" the other soldiers. Simply put, just hold X and the
direction down button when you get to control Cloud and he will run straight
into the open spot. Now let go of the X button and hold the direction left
button and Cloud will start marching in the same tempo as the others. Now, the
number "1" will pop up on the screen and you can start tapping the action
button to increase the percentage. If you do this right, you should have no
trouble getting 50% or more. My personal record is 65%! Do some practice and
you will find out that it's easier than you ever imagined.

Enter the door to the left to get out on the street.

First, the soldiers will show you what to do, and then you get to do some
practice yourself. You have to skip one box of text after they finish showing
you. That's after "right turn". Then it's your turn, but you can just watch.
Make sure to choose the second option when they ask if you've got it. That's
the fifth and last time we have to select the second option for now. Thank God.

As usual, he's arranged some company for us. Time to fight the first Jenova...


###############################################################################
                               B13: Jenova-BIRTH
###############################################################################
First of all, she must open the battle with Stop and it must miss. There's a
50% chance she opens the battle with Stop and it tends to miss very often, so
that shouldn't require too many restarts. Now, throw seven Grenades and use
Braver by taking advantage of the limit break system. That means you should
have Cloud throw the second and fifth Grenades. If Cloud doesn't have a limit
break now, you must have used it without permission and that's your problem.
Also, make sure to use Red's limit break as soon as possible. Then keep
throwing Grenades and make sure you get to use Braver at least once more. The
best is if you get to use it three times in total. There's also a chance you'll
have to heal, depending on how many times Jenova attacks. Ideally, she should
only use one attack per turn. You obviously lose time each time she uses a
combo, but it's up to you how many attacks you'll accept. The battle should end
after the second Stop.

*******************************************************************************
The perfect battle should go like this:

1. Grenade before Stop
2. Stop (miss), 7 Grenades + Braver
3. Laser on Cloud, 3 Grenades
4. Tail Laser, 3 Grenades + Braver
5. W-Laser, 3 Grenades
6. 2-3 grenades
7. Stop (miss), grenades until she dies

If you fail to throw a Grenade before Stop, you can use an additional Sled Fang
as long as you take advantage of the limit break system.

Restart if you get an encounter on your way to the entrance to Mt. Corel.



                                   Mt. Corel
                                  ###########

Head for the save point, but before you get there, you have to steal two Right
Arms from bombs on the bridge. Bombs come in groups of two here, so that you
can steal both of them in one battle. Restart if you get any other battle than
that. If you don't get a battle in this area, you have to run back and forth
until you get one.

When you get a battle with two Bombs, you have to steal a Right Arm from each
of them, but that's easier said than done. The chance of getting a Right Arm
isn't very high, so you most likely won't steal them in one attempt. That's not
a big deal unless you're doing a perfect run, though. However, you can't spend
too many attempts, or else it won't be worth it. I'd say restart if you spend
more than ten attempts in total. You will most likely have to restart quite a
few times here, but as I said in the intro, this is a challenge that requires
patience. Just be greatful if you're not doing a perfect run, because...

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners need even more patience, as you need to be able to steal them
in one attempt if you want the best possible result. But that's not all. First
of all, you have to make sure you get a battle on the bridge. Whether that
happens or not depends on how good you've done in areas with random encounters
from the very beginning of the game. If you haven't done good enough, you will
get that battle before you reach the bridge. As I said in the perfect run
section, you must make sure to get through the areas with random encounters as
quickly as possible, or else you'll get that battle too early and that ruins
everything. If you don't get a battle on the bridge, you have failed.

If you do get a battle on the bridge, you must of course make sure it's the
battle with two Bombs. Anything else is restart-material. There's a 17/64
chance you'll get that battle. Then comes the toughest part. If you truly want
a perfect run, you have to able to steal a Right Arm from each Bomb in only one
attempt each time. The chance for that to happen is about 1%. That's right, one
damn percent. How many attempts to allow is up to you.
*******************************************************************************


[SAVE YOUR GAME]
My time:          2:59:33 (I didn't steal any Right Arms)
No recommended times here until I complete the perfect run.


Tip: Before you proceed, you should play up to North Corel and save outside
town on a different file. You have to do some shopping here and that's
something that can cost you a lot of time if you screw up, so practicing it is
not a bad idea.


Move on. When the floor breaks, tap the action button like crazy and Cloud will
jump over. Restart if you fail. Then proceed to the shack to lower the bridge,
but make sure to stop by and pick up the Turbo Ether first. It's the purple
item. Aerith says "Go Cloud" or something like that when you're running over
the upper bridge, but that's nothing to worry about. When you get inside the
shack, however, you have to...

[skip text]

Then move on until you reach the final bridge before North Corel. Here, you
have to steal three more Right Arms. Don't accept more than 20 attempts in
total. Bombs only come in groups of one here, so you need at least three
battles. Just take note that you might also get attacked from both sides by
three Cokatolises. Sure sucks for perfect runners if you already managed to
steal a Right Arm in one attempt. Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do
about it. When you eventually have three Right Arms, you can proceed to North
Corel. Perfect runners only need two.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners have two choices here:

1. If you just move on, you will get a battle before the save point in Corel
Prison and if you run into a Bandit or two, they might steal an important item
from you. They always steal the best items, so you can't just hope they steal a
Phoenix Down or something. Getting a Right Arm stolen from you sure sucks after
restarting hundred times before you could steal them in one attempt, so you
really don't want that to happen.

2. To avoid getting a battle inside the prison, you can spend a couple of
seconds running back and forth on the bridge to make sure you get that battle
before North Corel. It's only a matter of two to three seconds, but as I said,
you might get attacked from both sides by three Cokatolises.

It's up to you. Either way, there's a chance you will have to start over and
restart another hundred or more times. I know, it sucks, but that's how a
perfect run is. I would go for option #2.

Steal and Bio. Then go fight Materia Keeper five times to see if you're able to
deal 99 damage. And make sure to save on a different file when you get there.
If you deal too little, you'll have to replace Steal with Lightning. If you
still deal too little damage, you have to give Poison to Cait and then find a
combination that works, but you also have to do some other materia changes. See
details below. Don't forget to delete the new file when you're done testing.

*******************************************************************************

After entering town, just run ahead to trigger the cutscenes.

Just run ahead and talking will start.

[skip text]

Then leave Nibelheim and head for the save point at Mt. Nibel. Enter pipe #2
inside the cave and you'll land just by the save point. Yes, you have to pick
up the Powersoul before you can jump down, but that's really a good thing,
since the Powersoul is the most important weapon in this run.

Note: You need Cait to have a limit break after Materia Keeper and Trine isn't
enough to fill his bar completely. Therefore, you have to make sure he takes
some damage on the way there. Go fight Materia Keeper and make sure he opens
with Trine first, so that you know exactly how much damage he needs to take.

*******************************************************************************
You're only supposed to get one battle on the way to the save point. If you get
a second battle just before the save point, you haven't been fast enough in the
areas with encounters. If that's the case, you'll lose 13 seconds or more.
*******************************************************************************

Before saving, you have to do the following equipment/materia changes:

Cloud: Equip the Silver Armlet and give him the amount of red and green materia
needed for him to be able to deal 99 damage with Bio. Or Cait/Tifa setup if
Cloud couldn't deal 99 damage even with the maximum amount of materia equipped.
Cait: Give him Cover and place him in back row.
Give Tranquilizers to everyone and heal the party to full health.

If you have to use Cait/Tifa strategy, you must do some additional changes:

Remove Cure=All from Tifa (this can affect the damage, but hopefully an
additional green/red materia on Cait will take care of that)
Give Cure=All to Cloud in the Silver Armlet.
Give Cait the required combination of red and green materias.
Also, if Tifa has a limit break, you must reset it.

I know this costs extra time, but you really have no choice if Cloud can't deal
99 damage with Bio whatsoever. You also have to change back to the original
Materia Keeper setup before Palmer, but you can keep Cure=All on Cloud, as he
needs it in the temple. Preferably before you save on the world map before
Rocket Town.

You really want to do these equipment changes before saving, as you have to
restart MANY times to get the Materia Keeper battle right. Practice it until
you can do it with your eyes closed before you do the major run.

                              B19: Materia Keeper
###############################################################################
This strategy requires a lot of luck, but since this battle is as close as you
can possibly get after a save point, it doesn't really matter.

First of all, he must open the battle with Trine. After changing our minds
about ten times, we finally came to the conclusion that we need Trine. If he
does, have Cloud cast Bio, Tifa Cure=All and Cait defend. Now, pray Cloud deals
99 damage with Bio and that Materia Keeper gets poisoned. If not, you can throw
a Right Arm at the party to quickly get back to the title screen. If he deals
99 damage and Materia Keeper gets poisoned, you can wait until he attacks again
and have Tifa Cure the character who just got attacked. Then watch what
happens. I'll let this one be a surprise for those who don't know what happens.

If you have to use the Cait/Tifa strategy, you must have Cait cast Bio, Tifa
attack and Cloud Cure=All in that order. Then have Cloud Cure the character who
got attacked.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After entering town, you have to skip two boxes of text before you get to
control Cloud. Then enter Cid's house and go out the backdoor to find the Tiny
Bronco. Shera will come for some talking.

[skip text]

Enter the shop in the middle of town.


Sell (regular runners): Wizer Staff, Jem Ring.
Buy (regular runners): 21x Potion, 15x Tranquilizer, 6x Phoenix Down,
17x Hi-Potion, 1x Tent.
Buy (perfect runners): 11x Potion, 19x Tranquilizer, 3x Phoenix Down,
2x Hi-Potion, 1x Tent (you don't have to sell anything).

Note: The amount of Hi-Potions is the total amount you need. Your amount at
this point can vary because you might had to use one in Midgar and because you
can win the from Stingers. There's a chance perfect runners don't have to buy
any at all.

Now go find Cid inside the rocket. You have to talk to him twice. The first
time includes naming him and you have to ask him about the rocket the second 
time, but that's the first option, so just...

[skip text]

Climb back down and enter Cid's house. Move just ahead and the long cutscene
will start. This one lasts for about five minutes.

You get to control Cloud again after Cid goes out to talk to the president.
Follow him outside.

[skip text]

Shera will take you back inside and tell you to go talk to Palmer in the
backyard, as he seems to be stealing the Tiny Bronco. Palmer will say something
when you enter the backyard, but you don't have to skip it. Just head over and
talk to him.

[skip text]


###############################################################################
                                  B20: Palmer
###############################################################################
The battle should go down in three turns :

1. Have Cloud cast Bio, Tifa throw a Molotov, Cait throw a Molotov and Cloud
use Cross-Slash, in that order.

Note: If Cloud's ATB bar isn't full enough and you have to wait too long for it
to fill up, Palmer might attack before Cait throws his Molotov. You can't allow
that to happen.

2. Have Tifa, Cait, Cloud and Tifa throw Molotovs in that order, followed by
Cait using Dice. With a 2400 Dice, the battle will most likely be over after
the next poison damage (or even before). True perfect runners must restart
until you get that 2400 Dice, but I suggest that you continue if you get at
least 1600. Then it should be over after two more Molotovs, or even one,
depending on Molotov/Cross Slash damage. Even a 1200 Dice could be enough, but
then you need two more Molotovs for sure. And with a little luck, Palmer won't
attack again.

3. 1-2 additional Molotovs in case Dice dealt low damage. With some luck,
Palmer will still not attack (he will only use Mako Gun once in the entire
fight, despite getting a low damage Dice, as you can see in the vid).

With any luck (he pretty much uses Mako Gun either once or twice, so the only
way to die is if he does use it twice and uses it twice on the same character)
you don't need any healing. If he uses it more than twice, you must restart.

Regular runners who don't want to restart until you get a 1600 Dice or higher
can just keep throwing Molotovs and have Tifa heal whenever someone gets
attacked. Even if you got a 300 Dice, it shouldn't take more than four extra
Molotovs to finish him off. If Cloud gets a limit break again, don't use it, as
you need it for Red Dragon.

next to the battle arena. Enter the third hole from the right to get there. Dio
will appear when you find it.

Time to fight on the battle arena. Well, not really. Just escape the battle as
you would escape from any other random battle. If you get a Flapbeat battle,
you can attempt to steal a T/S Bomb from one of them before you escape. The
chance of stealing one is about 39%.

you do, you will see more than one and thus lose valuable time.

You get to control Cloud again when Cait runs off with the keystone. Go to
Chocobo Square, the first hole from the right. Here, follow Cait Sith inside,
run around the circle and leave. Talking will start on the outside.

Form a party of Cloud, Aerith and Tifa and leave the Gold Saucer, but before

before you save.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners don't have to buy more Molotovs and you're not allowed to save

Have Cloud steal and Tifa cast Trine. This will end the battle, but you cannot
proceed unless you receive at least two T/S Bombs. The chance you'll win two
isn't very high, so make sure Cloud can steal one.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners must make sure Cloud gets hit by Flying Sickle, to build up
his limit break. It would be best if he got Sickle'd twice, as one isn't
enough, but he can also get attacked in a battle on the way to Red Dragon.

Our next destination is Gongaga. We have to go there to pick up one of the most
important materia in this challenge, namely Deathblow. Save just before you
reach town. After entering town, go left and you'll find Deathblow on the
second screen. Then leave town and head back to the Tiny Bronco.

If Cloud doesn't have a limit break, you should get into a battle with a Grand
Horn and make sure he gets Grand Punch'd while you're in the Gongaga area.

Both regular and perfect runners should save again before you get back to the
Tiny Bronco and you should also do the necessary equipment/materia changes for
the temple now.

Cloud: Remove the Power Wrist and give him HP Plus instead of Steal.
Tifa: Equip the Powersoul and the Power Wrist, replace All with Deathblow, give
her Steal in the weapon and remove Enemy Skill and give it to Aerith.
Perfect runners must give Tranquilizers to the girls now.

That's for the perfect strategies. If you don't want to restart tons of times
to get the boss battles right, you should do the additional changes:

Cloud: Give him Cover and All=Restore (if he isn't already equipped with it).
Aerith: Equip the Fire Ring.


[SAVE YOUR GAME]
My time:          I didn't save here, as I didn't go to Gongaga.
No recommended times here until I complete the perfect run.


Once back in the Tiny Bronco, you can head for the temple. If you don't know
exactly how to get there, you must find out and practice the route. Needless
to say, you cannot accept any battles on the way to the temple.

*******************************************************************************
Note: If you don't know exactly how to find the Lunar Harp, you must play ahead
and practice. Demon's Gate requires a lot of luck and you're not allowed to
save before entering town. Also, make sure to practice the equipment/materia
changes before Jenova-LIFE. She requires a lot of luck too, so you really want
to do the changes before you save.

Things will happen automatically when you reach the other side.

*******************************************************************************
If Cloud doesn't already have a limit break, you have to make sure he gets it

need her HP to be full before Red Dragon, and you can't rest, as that will make
Sadness go away.

Note: All the battles from this point depend on Tifa's strenght and Cloud's
magic. Since it can be different from file to file, you should always go ahead
and test it first and see if you deal the same (or more) damage than in the
videos. If you deal so much less that the tactics don't work (for example Carry
Armor doesn't go down after the second DB=AC) you have two choices:

- Perfect runners should restart and hope to get better stats at level up.
- Regular runners have to adapt the strategies. 

Most battles should work, so it shouldn't be too much to worry about. The only
battle where you need a specific stat is Schizo.


Jump down to the lowest level and enter the fourth door here to get back up.
Then enter the main door that leads to the room with the murals. Here, you have
to go through a lot of talking before the battle with Red Dragon, but it's not
as bad as Palmer.

It goes like this: Skip text, move ahead, skip text, move ahead, skip text,
move ahead and skip text again. Eventually, you get to fight...


###############################################################################
                                B22: Red Dragon
###############################################################################
First of all, Red Dragon must open the battle with Red Dragon Breath on Tifa.
There's a 1/4 chance he'll do that. If he does, have Aerith cast Death Sentence
on Tifa, Tifa use Deathblow and Cloud use Cross-Slash in that order. Then have
Tifa Deathblow, Aerith throw a Right Arm, Cloud defend and Tifa use Deathblow
again. If none of the Deathblows misses, the battle will be over now.

If she does miss, you can try again, but Red Dragon will start attacking again.
Have Aerith defend after throwing the Right Arm. Have Cloud Cure himself and
Aerith if they lose HP, but never Tifa, as her HP needs to stay yellow for
Deathblow to deal max damage. You can also revive Cloud and Aerith if they get
killed, but if Tifa gets killed, you know where the reset button is. Logically
enough, you lose time each time Deathblow misses, so it's up to you how many
misses you will accept.

*******************************************************************************
Guess you already figured that none of the Deathblows can miss, but it doesn't
hurt to mention it. Also, Red Dragon cannot attack more than the one time in
the beginning of the battle. After Cloud defends, you can just hold the action
button and you will automatically have Tifa use Deathblow.

Note: Tifa must have at least 36 Str for this strategy to work, but that most
likely won't be a problem. If it really is lower, you should remove some green
materia from Cloud, to get higher damage with Cross-Slash.

Pick up Bahamut and move on to the next area. Yes, to the right.

[skip text]

Leave the room. Before saving, you must have Cloud cure himself and Aerith back
to full health if they lost HP against Red Dragon. You can't rest, as Tifa's HP
needs to stay low. If you don't want to restart until you get the perfect
Demon's Gate strategy right, you have to set ATB to Recommended and you must
heal Cloud and Aerith to full health.

Then there's only one thing to do. Go get Demon's Gate. You have to skip a few
lines before he attacks.


###############################################################################
                               B23: Demon's Gate
###############################################################################
First of all, he must open the battle with waving his arms. That means Demon
Rush will be his next attack. If he does, have Cloud throw a Right Arm, Aerith
cast Death Sentence on Tifa and Tifa use Deathblow, in that order. Demon's Gate
will now start waving his arms again. Have Aerith throw a Molotov, Tifa use
Deathblow and Cloud give a Hi-Potion to Tifa, in that order. Demon's Gate will
then use Demon Rush. If it misses Tifa or criticals and kills someone, you must
restart. Then have Tifa use Deathblow again and the others throw Molotovs and
Demon's Gate will start waving his arms again. Repeat the last turn and the
battle should be over after the last Molotov if none of the Deathblows missed.

This is the optimal outcome, so perfect runners should restart until they pull
this off. Here's the regular battle:

DG must open the battle with waving his arms. On your first turn, have Aerith
throw a Right Arm, Tifa throw a Molotov (yes, she attacks in the video, but
Molotov is obviously better) and Cloud throw a Right Arm in that order. DG will
now wave his arms again. Then have Aerith cast Death Sentence on Tifa, Tifa use
Deathblow (must hit) and Cloud give a Hi-Potion to Tifa. DG will now use Demon
Rush. Now have Aerith throw a Molotov, Tifa use Deathblow (can miss) and Cloud
throw a Molotov. Even if Deathblow misses, DG will start waving his arms again.

The next part is complicated and I don't feel like re-writing everything lolo
said in the Speed Run topic, so I'll basically just copy/paste it. His writing
style here is a bit different from mine in the guide, but that shouldn't be a
problem. Oh, and just in case: DB = Deathblow and DR = Demon Rush.

You now have two options (I prefer number 1):

1. Gamble and not heal Aerith more than with Cure=All (the runner should
actually do tests to see how likely it is she survives in his game). She can
survive DR, but it can very well happen she dies.

- DB (can miss, but if both the second one and this one miss, you need to make
  sure the 4th one hits before DR), Potion on Tifa, Cure=All
- possibly another DB from Tifa.
- Demon Rush, Aerith could be KO'ed.


If Aeris is KO'ed:

If 2 DB hit for full damage:
- DB (has to hit), Molotov.
- DB (has to hit); Molotov + Cross-Slash can be enough, depending on the
  previous damage, but it's a gamble.

If 1 DB hits for full damage, one for half:
- DB (has to hit), Molotov.
- DB (has to hit)

If 2 DB hit for full damage, one for half:
- DB (has to hit and it could be over), Molotov if needed.

If 3 DB hit for full damage:
- DB (over if it hits). Cure=All/Hi-Potion.
If DB misses, he must use Rock Drop only once and on Cloud (you could also get
lucky and he uses it twice but misses) but then the next one should really hit.


If Aeris isn't KO'ed:

If 2 DB hit for full damage:
- DB (can miss), 2x Molotov.
- DB (can't miss if the previous one missed). Over if both hit, else 2 more
  Molotov will finish him (actually to make sure, one should use 3 Molotovs if
  the first Db hit).

If 1 DB hits for full damage, one for half:
- DB (has to hit), 2x Molotov.
- DB (over if it hits), Potion on Tifa (not needed if you know she has enough
  HP to survive DR, in which case, a Molotov should be used), Cure=All. If it
  misses, the next one (after DR) should hit (and finish him).

If 2 DB hit for full damage, one for half:
- DB + Molotov to end it.
Or to play it safe: DB (can miss), Cure=All, Hi-Potion on Tifa. If both Cloud
and Tifa survive the Rock Drops, DB again and hope it sticks this time.

If 3 DB hit for full damage:
- basically the same as above. 2x Molotov + Cross-Slash could be enough, but
  it's unlikely, so it's quite a gamble.


I didn't even bother mentioning it, but if you get 4 DB before the second DR,
and all 4 hit, and he's not dead, 1-2 Molotovs will finish him.

Most of the time it's possible to get more than 2 DB in before DR, as you can
see in the vid. But sometimes it will just not happen.


2. Heal everyone back to full

So Healing Wind instead of Potion to Tifa.

Same as above, you have to adapt the rest of the battle depending on how many
of the Deathblows hit (pausing the game and thinking ahead, as well as using a
calculator to keep track of his HP really helps here). The problem here is that
Tifa will not be in critical condition, so Deathblow will only deal half
damage. But with the help of Hi-Potions, one should be able to survive. No real
need to heal Aerith once he waves his Arms around again, she will die from the
third Demon Rush that way, but by then it should be close to over.

This one goes until Cloud wakes up in Gongaga, but you have to stop tapping

Place some searchers and you'll find it. Yes, it's always at the same spot.

When you successfully receive the Lunar Harp, you can enter the forest and get

kill her. You'll have one line to skip too, before the infamous FMV.

[skip text]


###############################################################################
                                B24: Jenova-LIFE
###############################################################################
Start the battle by having Cloud cast Death Sentence on Tifa, Cait throw a
Molotov at Tifa and Tifa use Deathblow in that order. Unfortunately, a Molotov
isn't enough to bring her HP down to the yellow level, so she has to eat an
attack from Jenova as well. That's ONE attack. Two will kill her. Have Cloud
use Cross-Slash when Tifa attacks and then have Tifa use Deathblow twice to end
the battle. As always, Deathblow can't miss for this strategy to work.

Jenova likes to attack often, so this battle can be very fatal if Deathblow
should miss. As long as Tifa stays alive, you can keep trying, but she's not
likely to stay alive for a very long time. Also, you need Cloud and Cait to be
standing when you kill her, so make sure they don't die. You can have Cloud
heal if you gave him Cure=All before the temple. Oh, and Aqualung = instant
game over, so you don't want to see that attack.

*******************************************************************************
As usual, Deathblow can't miss for perfect runners. In addition, you don't
really have to throw the Molotov. It's very likely Jenova will attack twice
before you get to act, so she "just" has to attack Tifa twice, and you save
yourself the animation time of a Molotov.

Move ahead, skip some text and follow Sephiroth to the next area.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                         4.1 <> Adventures In The Snow
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You have to climb some walls in the second area, and you have to pick up the
Bolt Armlet. First, climb the second wall and jump off to the left. Then climb
the next wall and jump off to the left. You can actually open the chest with
the Bolt Armlet from the ledge below it, so you don't have to climb up to it.
After picking it up, jump to the opposite side of the wall, run across the
screen to the next wall. Jump off to the left, climb the next wall and choose
to climb down the ladder. You'll find the Magic Plus Materia on the bottom, a
materia that is very important for some strategies to work. After picking it
up, you can climb all the way up and exit the cave. Run for about ten seconds
before you save on the world map. You have to save twice.

*******************************************************************************
It's possible to only save once on the world map, but then you have to wait
longer than ten seconds before you save. A very luck requiring part is coming
up, so I suggest that you find out where the latest possible point you can get
the first battle is and then restart until you manage to save just before that
spot. You might have to replay the first part of disc two a lot of times, but
it's totally worth it.
*******************************************************************************

Before saving, you should give Tranquilizers to everyone and heal the party to
full health.

                                  ############

Enter the first house to the right and find the map. Choose the second option
to take it. You won't be allowed to go snowboarding without it, so you kinda
have no choice but to pick it up. Also, pick up the item to the right in the
room behind it. You don't need the left one. Then go talk to the guy at the
edge of town. Elena will show up.

[skip text]

Just tap the left button to dodge her punch. After talking, enter the house in
the middle of town and talk to the kid. You have to skip two boxes of text
before he lets you take the snowboard. Then there's nothing else to do than go
snowboarding. Just run past the man and exit the screen to start the minigame.

Tap the direction up button and Cloud will take off. Go right at the first
intersection and left in the second. What else can I say? If you want to lose
as little time as possible, you should practice this minigame until you get
good at it. The most fatal parts are the forest and the crystal caves. If you
crash, it'll most likely happen there. In the forest, you should go next to the
right wall. If you find the right spot, you don't have to dodge any trees at
all, but you have to take a sharp left to avoid a tree at the end. That's
something you must practice. The area with snow boulders coming from the sides
can also be tricky, but if you go a little to the left from the center, you
should be able to avoid most of them without making any sharp turns. It's all
about finding the right spot.

BrutalAl's record in the NTSC version is 2:27:20. That was the last time that
was possible to read. In the NTSC version, the timer fades instead of stopping,
which is pretty stupid. I said I would beat this record, but as of today, I
haven't managed to beat it yet. As always, it's up to you, but I suggest
restarting if the timer passes three minutes. That's for the NTSC version. PAL
and NTSC times are different in this minigame, so three minutes is a better
result in the PAL version. If you use the PAL version, you should restart if
you pass 3:15.

[skip text]

Leave this screen through the exit to the right and follow this path until you
reach the screen with four exits. Here, head for the exit in the upper right
corner. However, before you leave this screen, you have to get into a battle
with an enemy called Snow (you know, that hot chick) and steal a Circlet.
Sounds simple? It's not. First of all, you should get the battle "on the run",
meaning that you don't spend extra time running around to get the battle. Of
course, you have no choice if you don't get a battle on that screen, but let's
hope that doesn't happen. The chance to get a single Snow battle here is 12/64.
She can also be accompanied by two Bandersnatches in a side attack, but you
don't want that battle. If you get any other battle, you should restart. Yes,
you have to replay the snowboarding, but you'll lose too much time if you run
around until you get the right battle. And especially if you keep getting the
wrong battle.

Stealing the Circlet isn't easy either. You have a ~7,8% chance of stealing it
in one attempt. Again, it's up to you how many attempts to accept, but don't
forget that Snow isn't just standing there. Her Fascination confuses you and
that doesn't really make it any easier. Perfect runners must be able to steal
it in one attempt.

Note: You can also encounter Snow on the screen where you land, so you can
steal the Circlet here if you get a battle here without running around.

When you finally manage to steal it, you can leave this screen and follow this
path until you reach the wide open area, but don't forget to pick up the Added
Cut Materia on the second screen. If you don't know exactly where it is, you
should find out before you do the major run. In the wide open area, just head
north and place markers all the time. A blizzard will mess up the camera angle,
but thanks to the markers, you'll always know where to run. Eventually, you'll
reach Mr. Holzoff's hut. Enter and find the save point. The following equipment
and materia changes must be done before saving:

Cloud: Dragon Armlet and Circlet. Give him Magic Plus instead of Fire and
Restore=All instead of Ramuh and shiva.
Tifa: Fire Ring. Give her Added Cut instead of Restore.
Cait: Bolt Armlet. Give him Elemental=Lightning in the armor, Gravity instead
of Manipulate and Fire instead of Transform.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners must give Elemental=Lightning to Tifa instead of Cait. Other
than that, everything is the same.

Then leave and head for the cliffs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                              4.2 <> Gaea's Cliff
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can get through the first climbing without recovering your temperature, so
make sure to practice it if you don't want to lose time here. Then get through
the first cave area as quickly as possible and make sure to pick up the Ribbon.
However, you can't just leave without doing some work first. You have to learn
Magic Breath. As you probably know, this enemy skill is learned from Stilva,
and these giant spiders lurk inside these caves. As with the Circlet, you must
learn it "on the run" to lose as little time as possible, but that shouldn't be
a problem. I've run through these caves many times, but only a few times have I
not encountered Stilva. Just make sure to keep Cloud at full health or at least
close to full until the Stilva battle, as he won't survive otherwise.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners should restart if Cloud gets attacked before the Stilva battle,
as you lose a lot of time each time you have to heal.
*******************************************************************************


###############################################################################
                                  B25: Stilva
###############################################################################
Pray that Magic Breath is used as soon as possible. Cloud needs full HP to be
able to survive, so make sure to Cure him if he gets attacked physically. Tifa
will take no damage from Magic Breath and Cait will be healed, so you don't
have to worry about them. Just make sure they don't get killed. Of course, you
lose time each time the Stilva uses another attack, so restart if you feel that
you've lost too much time. When Magic Breath is used, you must quickly have
Cloud cast it back, to kill the enemy.

Note: You have to hope for two things: First, that Cloud has enough HP to
survive Magic Breath. Thanks to the Circlet it should only deal around 800
damage. Second, that he kills the Stilva with one Magic Breath. Both should go
well, but I'm just pointing out that both are close. If needed, you can remove
green materia from Cloud.

*******************************************************************************
Magic Breath must be the first and only attack Stilva uses.

###############################################################################


Heal the party after the battle and proceed. It's impossible to get through the
second climbing without recovering your temperature, but if you're fast, you
only have to recover a couple of degrees. Recover five, just in case.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners can only recover the necessary amount of degrees, which seems
to be 2, but that really requires you to climb perfect, so recover 3. Also, in
addition to giving Cait the Ribbon, you must give Tifa the Power Wrist before
the Icicle battles. And also, don't pick up the Elixir in the next cave.
*******************************************************************************

When you reach the next cave, go right to pick up the Elixir and then head for
the save point. Before saving, you must give the Ribbon to Cait and give an
Elixir to Cloud.

My time:         5:22:20
Rec. time (10h): 6:00:00
Rec. time (12h): 7:12:00


Then it's time to go fight some Icicles. When you reach the area where the
Icicles are, make sure to pick up the Fire Armlet before you start fighting the
Icicles. That's for regular runners only.


###############################################################################
                            B26: Icicle + Evilheads
###############################################################################
The battles should go like this:

1. Cait: Demi on the Icicle
2. Cloud: Trine (kills the bats)
3. Tifa: Molotov

Sounds simple? It's not. The Evilheads live up to their names, as they have an
attack called Ultrasound. Guess what it does. Yup, Silence. Cait has a Ribbon,
but Cloud doesn't, so pray they don't use this attack on him before Trine has
been cast. But that's not all. There's also a chance that Demi might miss, so
getting through these three battles requires a lot of luck.

If you managed to steal a T/S Bomb from a Flapbeat on the battle arena, you can
use it in one of the battles instead of Demi. The Icicles are weak against
Gravity, so it will kill them instantly. However, you need the EXP from the
Evilheads, so you have to cast Trine first. If Trine deals even damage, you can
use the T/S Bomb. If the Icicle has odd HP, like 1965, the T/S Bomb will only
deal 1964 damage. The reason for that is because the original 982,5 damage is
rounded down first.

*******************************************************************************
The Icicle has a 50% chance to counter any attacks with Icicle Drop, except
when you kill him, so this can happen 0 to 6 times. Of course, the best would
be if it never happened, but that's a 1/64 chance, something you don't want in
addition to the luck these battles already require. I say restart if it happens
more than three times.

Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hg-2mghFaA
###############################################################################


After each battle, you get to choose if you want to jump down. Select the
first option after the first two battles and proceed to the next Icicle. You
only have to fight three of them, so select the second option after the third
battle, to jump down. Make sure to heal the party to full health between the
battles, unless you lost very little HP.

When you finally get through the battles, you can jump down and proceed. Don't
bother healing Tifa; it's actually a good thing if she dies in battle on the
way to Schizo. Also, make sure to pick up the Enhance Sword. It's in the only
chest you pass by on the way up. Perfect runners don't have to pick it up. The
next climbing session is the easiest, so recovering your temperature shouldn't
be necessary, but I recommend recovering a few degrees just in case.

When you reach the cave, head directly for the save point. Do not touch the
healing spring! You have to do a couple of things before you save. First, give
the Fire Armlet to Cait. Then heal Cloud and Cait to full health. If Tifa died
in battle on the way here, you can simply give her a Phoenix Down, a Hi-Potion
and a Tranquilizer. Otherwise, heal her to 700-800 HP. You can't heal her to
full health, as she needs to be in a certain HP range in order for Schizo to
reduce her HP to the critical range with his regular attack. And finally, set
ATB to Recommended.

You also have to reset Tifa's limit bar if it's too full. You should test run
and see if she gets a limit break after getting attacked by the ice head. If
she does, you have to reset it. This won't be a problem if Tifa died on the way
here, so you should really aim for that to happen.


*******************************************************************************
Tifa's strength must be EXACTLY 77 for the perfect Schizo strategy to work, so
if it's higher, you need to adjust it with green materia. If it's lower, well,
then you have no choice but to replay the Icicle battles. Thankfully, that's
not very likely to happen. Also, give the Fire Ring to Cait.

Rec. time (10h): 6:08:24
Rec. time (12h): 7:22:05


Before you attempt Schizo for real, you should go beat him once and see if you
get a random battle after Schizo, before you exit the cave. If that happens,
you won't be able to escape it, because of a glitch. It most likely won't
happen, but if it does, you have to run around some to make sure you get the
battle before Schizo. You lose a few seconds, but it really can't be helped.
You can also run around before you save and hope saving removes the battle, but
you have to test run from the save before the Icicles to see if that works.


###############################################################################
                                  B29: Schizo
###############################################################################
This is by far the most annoying battle in this challenge. At least for perfect
runners. To get through this battle, you have to obey the following rules:

1. No one is allowed to die during the battle.
2. Heal Cloud and Cait whenever they get attacked, and make sure to do this
   before you have Tifa attack.
3. Make sure to keep track of each head's HP and how many times you've attacked
   the fire head. It counters every fifth attack with Quake3.

And a reminder: The more times Deathblow misses, the more time you lose. It's
up to you how many misses to accept.


The strategy is pretty simple, but it requires a bit of luck. First of all, the
ice head must attack Tifa on its first turn. That'll bring her HP down to the
critical level, so that she can deal twice as much damage with her attacks. On
your first turn, have Cait give a Hero Drink to Tifa, Cloud cast Death Sentence
on Tifa and Tifa Deathblow the ice head (left), in that order.

If the first Deathblow sticks, you have two options:

1. Heal Tifa to full health and continue to use Deathblow (and heal) every turn
   until the ice head dies. Deathblow can't miss four times in a row, or else
   he'll use the Quake3 counter attack. There's a very small chance that will
   happen, though.

2. Don't heal Tifa and attack the ice head with a regular attack. For this
   tactic to work, the ice head must attack Cloud/Cait on turn two and three.
   After the second regular attack, the ice head will be almost dead. On the
   turn where Tifa attacks for the second time (third turn), have Cloud cast
   Cure=All. Then quickly have Cait use a Hi-Potion on Tifa and have Tifa 
   Deathblow to finish him. If Deathblow misses, the ice head will still die.
   If it sticks, you'll get a full damage Added Cut attack on the fire head.

If the first Deathblow missed, you can simply Deathblow again. If this sticks,
you can either take the risk and attack once regularly (and not heal Tifa) or
heal Tifa. If the second Deathblow misses, the third has to hit and then you
can finish the ice head with another Deathblow.

When you kill the ice head, Schizo will use his final attack and bring Tifa's
HP back to the critical level. Now, give a Hi-Potion to Cloud and make sure to
keep track of how much damage you've dealt to the fire head. Tifa deals about
7000 damage with Deathblow and 3500 with Added Cut on critical HP. The table
below tells you what to do when you've dealt this and that much damage. In
addition, you must heal Cloud when/if needed.

0:     Deathblow. Miss will bring you to 3500 and hit will bring you to 10500.
3500:  Deathblow. Miss will bring you to 7000 and hit will bring you to 14000.
7000:  Deathblow. This one must hit and it will bring you to 17500.
10500: Heal the party to full health and use Deathblow twice to kill him. Both
       must hit, or else he'll Quake3 you. You can also not heal the party and
       use Deathblow and hope it misses, but I wouldn't recommend it. If you
       do, it will bring you to 14000 HP.
14000: Heal the party to full health and use Deathblow to kill him. Must hit.
17500: Heal the party to full health and use Deathblow or Dice. You will kill
       him either way.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect strategy:

This is the most luck-requiring battle in the whole challenge. First of all,
one of the heads must attack Tifa to bring her HP down to the critical level.
The other head must attack Cloud or Cait. The best thing would be if the ice
head attacks Tifa and the fire head attacks Cait. On your first turn, have
Cloud cast Death Sentence on Tifa, Cait give her a Hero Drink and Tifa use
Deathblow in that order. It doesn't matter if this Deathblow misses. When
Schizo attacks again, just pray he doesn't kill anyone.

If the first Deathblow missed, you must now have Tifa Deathblow again and this
time it must stick. If the first one stuck, have her attack regularly now.
Either way, you must then have Cloud Cure=All and Cait cast Fire2 in that
order. That'll take care of the ice head, but make sure to have Tifa attack
regularly again before she takes damage from the final attack and her limit bar
fills up. Cloud and Cait don't have to do anything this turn. As for Schizo, he
must attack either Cloud or Cait. On your final turn, have Tifa Deathblow,
Cloud Cure=All and Cait use Dice in that order. Logically enough, Deathblow
must stick. Otherwise, you're screwed.

Note: It can be a problem to use Fire2 in time. Make sure to set the cursor to
Fire2 while waiting for Tifa's bar to fill and then be lightning quick at
selecting everything (Attack, Cure=All, Fire2). You should practice this before
you attempt the battle for real.

It should be mentioned that there is an even faster strategy, but it has odds
worse than 1/300. Here's a video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t75LJjOS5es

When you eventually beat him, you can just exit the cave and climb up to the

sure to run as far as you can. By doing that, you will start in the next area
after the scene with the crater.

Note: If Tifa dies in battle on the way to Jenova, you can revive her with a
Phoenix Down, but don't do it before you reach the area where the Jenova battle
takes place. Else she might die again and the time you spent reviving her goes
down the drain together with the Phoenix Down you used.

Just move on when the talking is over. You will run into a caped man on the way
down here, but just "talk to him" to make him disappear. The party will stop
for some talking again in the next area.

Then proceed to the save point, but make sure to pick up Neo Bahamut on the

Here, you won't see Cloud at first, but you can control him all the time. Move
left and a little up now and then and you should be able to get as far as
possible. This is something you should practice if you want to save as much
time as possible. If you don't know what you're doing, you will most likely run
into something and get stuck. Anyway, make sure to pick up the Kaiser Knuckles
on your way through this area.

Next comes the second whirlwind crossing, but here you can't just run over. In
addition to the wind, there are green whirlwinds here. It's safe to cross after
the fourth one. You only have to wait a few seconds, though. Then we have the
area where the Jenova battle takes place. If Tifa has been killed in battle,
you must revive her now and heal Cloud to full health. Just don't heal Tifa.

After a certain amount of time (always the same) Cloud will walk to a spot and
then the FMV will start. In the meantime you can run around. But the best is,
of course, to get him at the exact spot he will walk to anyway. A very easy way
to get almost exactly there is to walk (walk, not run!) there by doing a step
up (push up, this is to turn around), then a step down and right (push down +
right, you get it I hope >_>), and then right.

Well, just head to the save point. Some preparations must be done before the
train battles.

Cid:  Give him Gravity and Steal in the weapon and Elemental=HP Plus (the one
      with the most AP) in the armor. Also, place him in back row.
Red:  Equip the Seraph Comb and give him Enemy Skill and Restore=All.
Cait: Equip the Wizard Armlet and the Circlet. Give him the following materia
      in this exact order:
      Weapon: Magic Plus, MP Plus, Ramuh and Lightning.
      Armor:  4x MP Plus, Enemy Skill (the one with Trine), Neo Bahamut, Fire
              and Bahamut.

Finally, use a Tent and give Tranquilizers to everyone.

Then you have to catch up with the train, something I really hate. I managed
9:57 once, but I've never gotten close again. Seriously, I have no idea how
this works. Even if you push the buttons as fast as you can without screwing
up, you might not be able to catch up with the train before 9:30. As always,
you decide what to accept, but I would restart after 9:45. After jumping over
to the other train, you have to move a bit ahead to trigger the first battle.
You can heal between battles if necessary, but it is possible to get through
all the battles without having to heal.

Perfect runners can heal after Wolfmeister, when you have to give a Turbo Ether
to Cait. And obviously, Demi can't miss.

Magic Breath twice and you didn't get an S-mine from the Attack Squad battle,
Demi can't miss.

                                 #############

No need to talk to the man here. Just run past him on the right side and climb
up to the main area. Here, talk to the old man by the table. Then climb up to
the top and talk to the man here. Select the sixth and second option to start
the minigame.

Since it's faster, you have to win the minigame. Here's how you do it:

- Before the battle starts, place one Fighter at the lowest possible point.
- Then start the battle.
- Quickly place other Fighters, always as low as possible. Each time you place
  a Fighter, you will be able to place the next one lower. After five more
  Fighters, you should be close to where the enemies appear (on the right side
  of the screen).
- Now place three Attackers as close as possible to the first enemy, that by
  now will have appeared on the screen, and order them to attack it.
- Turn up the battle speed.
- Look at them quickly destroying the enemy. If you were fast enough they will
  kill the enemy before other enemies appear and you will win the minigame. If
  other enemies appear, then you're too slow.

This may sound complicated, but it's really not. Just practice it a few times,
and you should easily get the hang of it. I mastered it after two attempts.

You have two objectives in this battle: Survive and steal a Cursed Ring. UW
will flee after three attacks, so there's no need to deal any damage.

UW will open the battle with Quake2 and Barret will die. Now have Red give an
X-Potion to Cid and have Cid steal. Next, UW attacks with his claw and this
attack must be used on Red. If you failed to steal the first time, have Cid
steal again. Finally, UW will use Ultima Beam and you get one last chance to
steal before he runs off. If you failed to steal the Cursed Ring... you know.

Note: There's a chance Quake2 will kill Red. You can't have that happen. If it
happens too often, you should give him a Tranquilizer before the battle.

*******************************************************************************
If Red gets killed too often, you should still restart until it doesn't happen.
You don't have a Tranquilizer to spare and it does cost time. But hey, you just

Talk to the man in front of the elevator and pay him the 10 Gil. Then take the

This battle is really annoying. Both of the enemies will attack three times

Have Cloud cast Trine to kill them.

*******************************************************************************
Either have Cloud cast Magic Breath or Tifa use Deathblow (depending on who's
ATB gauge is fuller) to try to avoid getting attacked six times. You should at
least make sure only one of the enemies gets to attack.
###############################################################################


Move on. Halfway through the next area, the party will stop and watch as the
Huge Materia is taken out of the reactor. Before entering the next area, you
should heal Tifa to 300-350 HP with Potions. Just make sure her HP stays in
critical condition. That's regular runners only. Perfect runners can't heal.

###############################################################################
This battle is really simple, but there are many things that can go wrong.
First of all, Lapis Laser and Arm Grab can never be used. There's a 1/3 chance
he'll use Lapis Laser as a Sneak Attack and there's a 1/4 chance he'll use it
as his first attack, so he will open the battle with this attack at least half
the time. My record is five times in a row and lolo's is 11! On top of this,
Tifa must get two successful Deathblows. And yes, you have to replay the last
two battles and go through the boring cutscenes each time something goes wrong.
 

Strategy: Have Tifa Deathblow, Cloud cast Magic Breath and Tifa Deathblow
again. That's it. The battle will be over after Tifa's last attack if none of
the Deathblows missed. Regular players can always try again if one should miss,
but you will most likely get destroyed by Lapis Laser.

Move on. Three more battles await before you can save inside the sub, but first
you have to do some healing. Heal the guys to full health first. As for Tifa,
she needs to get back to critical HP before Rude and that can be a little
tricky with all the forced battles in between.

If you have two Molotovs or more and you don't mind wasting a few seconds, you
can use Cure on her twice, which should bring her to full health. If you only
have one Molotov or you don't want to waste any time, you can only use Cure
once. That will bring her to about 950 HP, but that can be a little risky. If
you don't want to take the risk, give her a couple of Potions too.


*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners can only use Cure once on Tifa. As I said, that can be a little
risky, but it should be enough to get safely to the save point inside the sub.
If you don't want to take the risk, you can heal her to full health, but then
it will be trickier to get her HP to critical condition before Rude and you
might lose a little time. It's up to you.

During these dialogues, you have to select the second option three times. After
the third time, the submarine game will start.

This can be done really quickly if you know what you're doing. My record is
9:51. Start climbing as soon as the minigame starts, but wait for about one
second before you start moving forwards. By doing this, you will find yourself
just behind the red sub within a few seconds. Now hit the square button rapidly
until you take it out. Do some practice, and you should easily be able to make
it in 9:50. I wouldn't accept anything below 9:45, even in a regular run.

After talking, Cloud will take the submarine back to the surface and exit.
Rocket Town is next, but first we have to go pick up the ancient key from the

Note: If you don't already have three S-mines, you have to make sure you do
after the third battle.

Note 2: Tifa's HP must be critical before Rude and that can be a problem if you
enter Rocket Town with a lot of HP. Hopefully, a Molotov will be enough, but if
not, you have to make sure she gets attacked in the first three battles.

Materia. Then remove Cover and give it to Cloud instead of Ultima. Place Ultima
in the armor instead of Ice. Tifa: Give her Elemetal=Fire and Steal in the

You can use the Wait Trick to make this battle easier.

Same strategy for perfect runners, except for Cloud casting Magic Breath every
turn. Also, Dice must deal at least 1500 damage and Deathblow can't miss.

Note: If Tifa's Strength is lower than 113, you need a higher damage Dice. You
can also cast Trine instead of getting a higher damage Dice, but obviously,
that costs extra time.

Then you can climb down the ladder to the plate area. If you don't know exactly
how to get through this area, you need to do some practice runs. It's not that
hard, though. Just run downstairs and climb down the ladder to reach the next
area. Here, go right and jump over to the plate that breaks. When you land on
the lower level, you only have one way to go. After jumping through the shaft,
you only have to go upstairs to find the save point.

and Cloud enter a sub-menu. Exit the sub-menu when you see the damage dealt by
Added Cut and have Cloud defend as well. Then, quickly Deathblow Reno again and
Tifa should be able to attack before they do.

If one Deathblow should miss, you can always try again, but don't forget that
Tifa is far from immortal. She can survive an attack from Elena or Reno, but
that's it. This battle is just after a save point anyway, so reloading until
you get two Deathblows shouldn't be that much of a problem.

select Attack and place the cursor at Proud Clod. Confirm the attack when you
see the damage dealt by Tifa's Added Cut attack and have Tifa Deathblow again
and the other guy select attack again. Repeat this until you kill him. Of
course, you have to restart if Deathblow keeps missing, but it's always up to
you how many misses to accept. You can also use Cloud and Cait's limit breaks
when/if they get them and throw S-mines if you have any.

*******************************************************************************
On the first turn, have Cloud attack, Tifa use Deathblow and Cait select an
S-mine and set the cursor at Proud Clod. Throw the S-mine when you see the
damage from Tifa's Added Cut attack and follow up with another Deathblow and
have Cloud select Attack. Abort the attack when you see the damage from Tifa's
Added Cut and have Tifa Deathblow, Cloud attack and Cait select S-mine. Throw
the S-mine when you see the damage from Cloud's attack and have her Deathblow
one last time. The battle will be over after Tifa's Added Cut if Deathblow
never missed. You know what to do if it does.

Proud Clod can use all of his attacks twice per turn and that obviously costs
extra time. If the Wait Trick works every time and he never attacks twice per
turn, he will only attack twice in total. That's the perfect approach, but you
can accept three attacks to make it a little less luck dependant. After all,
you need four Deathblows to hit and you have to redo The Turks each time. Also,
there's a little chance he will go down on his knees after the second DB. The
animation is long, so restart if that happens. Materia Jammer's animation is
also rather long, so try to avoid that one too.

Note: If Tifa has less than 119 Strength, the damage won't add up and you can
use an additional S-mine, cast Magic Breath or Ultima or hope for a critical.
You can also redo Diamond Weapon and hope you get higher stats at level up.

Move on. Open the two chests in the next area and head to the save point. You
have to do a couple of things before saving.

Cloud: Equip Ragnarok and give him two green/red materia to boost his magic.
Tifa: Equip the Mystile.
Heal the guys to full health.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners don't have to equip Ragnarok and the Mystile, but you have to
reset Cait's limit bar.
*******************************************************************************

Note: If you get a battle in the area with the save point, it will be with a
Grosspanzer either way and these guys are known for dealing heavy damage. If
you get one before the save point and a character gets killed, you can simply
use a Phoenix Down, but I recommend restarting if someone gets killed on the
way to Hojo.

Time to go pay a visit to Hojo. Near the top of the first staircase, Cait will
"come out of Cloud" and move on a little bit and then Cloud will automatically
follow him. After that, you can just climb to the top and find Hojo.

Have Tifa Deathblow and Cait cast Magic Breath. Then quickly select Deathblow
and Ultima, in that order, before he dies. Deathblow can't miss now that Tifa

Tifa and Cloud will now open the battle with Deathblow and Ultima. Afterwards,
have Tifa Deathblow again. With a little luck, she will perform this Deathblow
before Hojo gets a turn and you will kill him without him ever getting a turn!

Have Tifa Deathblow, Cloud attack and Cait attack, in that order. If they have
limit breaks, you must use them instead. Then have Tifa Deathblow again and
Cloud cast Ultima and the battle will be over.

The only thing that can go wrong in this battle is that he might put Cloud to
sleep or attack Tifa. Restart if that happens. Also, there's a chance Tifa
might be able to attack before Hojo gets a turn, but that's not good, as he
will then counter Tifa with Combo. Therefore, you must wait until he attacks
before you command Tifa to Deathblow.

Have Tifa Deathblow, Cloud attack and Cait attack, in that order. Then have
Tifa Deathblow again and the battle will be over.

Yes, you need five Deathblows to hit in these battles. For an easier strategy
where you only need four, have Tifa attack on the first turn and then have
Cloud finish him off with Ultima.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Climb down the ladder and run to the bottom of the screen. There's no turning
back now, so choose the first option to go down. Before doing anything now, you
must open the menu and set ATB back to Active. It's harder to escape battles on
Wait, so you will lose more time than it takes to set ATB to Active if you
don't do it. On the way down to the bottom, there are three items you need to
pick up and the first is the Save Crystal. As you most likely know, it's
located in the very first treasure box you find. Open it and get through this
area as quickly as possible. In the second area, just take the right path and
you'll be at the bottom in no time.

The third area can be a little tricky and I suggest that you practice it if you
don't know exactly how to get through here. First, jump off and head right
until you land next to a cave opening. Enter and run through here. Then jump
off, go right, left (while jumping down twice) and right again. In the fourth
area, you meet up with the crew.

[skip text]

Send Cloud, Tifa and Cait to the left and the others to the right. Left is the
first option and right is the second. Then proceed to the next area.

[skip text]

Send everyone up, which is the first option. The second item you need to pick
up is the Hero Drink located in a treasure box on the bottom right side of the
second swamp area. The third and final item you have to pick up is the W-Magic
Materia, which is located in the next area. It's partly hidden in the green
stuff on the top of the screen. You should be able to see it. If not, you'll
have to do a practice run and find out exactly where it is. After picking it
up, just proceed to the next area, which also happens to be the bottom.

Think of this area as a clock and place the Save Crystal at 8. Give W-Magic to
Cloud and Tranquilizers to Cloud and Cait before you save. Perfect runners have
to do a few more things.

*******************************************************************************
Cloud: Give him W-Magic along with two green or red filler materias to boost
his magic stat. Perfect runners must also equip Ragnarok.
Tifa: Equip the Mystile.

Move on. You'll have one box of text to skip when you enter the next area. Then
approach the exit to trigger the cutscene.

[skip text]

You'll be given the chance to form a party, but you know very well what I said
before entering Midgar, so just hit the cancel button.

Then.... let's mosey!

On the way down, there's a 25% chance you'll get a battle each time you land on
a rock. Yup, it's possible to reach the bottom without getting into a single
battle, but the chance is just too small. My record is one battle and I've done
it at least 100 times. How many battles to accept is up to you. Before entering
the final area, you must heal the guys to full health and revive Tifa (she's
most likely dead) and give her a Tranquilizer. Otherwise, just give her a
Tranquilizer. Also, make sure to set ATB to Recommended. Things will happen
automatically when you enter the final area.

*******************************************************************************
Perfect runners shouldn't accept more than three battles on the way down and
you have to reach the bottom without having to heal. Also, you don't have to
give the Tranquilizer to Tifa.

###############################################################################
Note: When the battle begins, the ATB bars will fill a little bit and then stop
for about 10 seconds. It's possible that one or more characters get a turn now,
but in that case, just wait.

On your first turn, have Cait cast DeBarrier on Sephiroth, Tifa Deathblow and
Cloud W-Magic Ultima. Sephiroth will now cast Shadow Flare and all you can do
is pray it misses. It most likely won't on Cloud and Cait, so you must also
pray he uses it on Tifa. If someone gets killed, you won't be able to defeat
him. Sure sucks, but that's how it is. Either way, have Cait throw an S-mine,
Tifa Deathblow and Cloud W-Magic Ultima, as you must select the commands before
Shadow Flare. Finally, have Tifa Deathblow again and the battle will be over.

Note: If the damage doesn't add up, you can have Cait cast Magic Breath instead
of throwing the S-mine. If it still doesn't add up (very unlikely), you can use
Dice and pray for good damage or make sure Cait learns Shadow Flare (very very
unlikely) and cast it. However, depending on your stats, you might not need to
throw the S-mine at all, so you should do some test runs and see how much
damage you deal with 3x DB=AC and 4x Ultima. Just take note that the leveling
up after Jenova affects the stats.

Recommended times for beating these bosses will be added when I complete the
perfect run.

It's not over yet. As said in the intro, you have to reach the point where you
can no longer control the game and make decisions before the game is considered
beaten. And that's when Sephiroth himself has been defeated.

[skip text]

Finally, the battle with Sephiroth himself. To Omnislash or not to Omnislash?
Sure, it's a cool move, but this time, it'll only make your result worse. Just
wait until Sephiroth attacks and Cloud will counterattack. Stop the stopwatch
exactly when you see the damage dealt by the counterattack.

My time: 14:50



                           Calculating The Final Time
                          ############################

If you use the NTSC version, you can simply add the time after Sephiroth to the
time after Bizarro and you have your final time.

Unfortunately, it's not that easy for PAL gamers. You have to divide the time
after the final Sephiroth by 1,2 and then add it to the time before Bizarro.
Here's a step by step explanation on how to do that. I'll use the time from my
last PAL run as an example. My time after Bizarro was 8:49:33 and the time
after Sephiroth himself was 31:51.


1. Divide the seconds by 60 to turn them into decimals:  51 / 60 = 0,85

2. Add the minutes:  0,85 + 31 = 31,85

3. Divide this time by 1,2:  31,85 / 1,2 = 26,54167

4. Multiply the decimals with 60 to get the seconds:  0,54167 x 60 = 32

5. Take the minutes from point 3 and the seconds from point 4.  26:32

6. Add the seconds from the time after beating Sephiroth:  32 + 33 = 65. If
   this number is higher than 60, then subtract 60 and add one minute to the
   final time. It happened here:  65 - 60 = 5.  5 seconds, and 1 minute to be
   added to the final time.

7. Add the minutes:  49 + 26 = 75. If the number is higher than 60, then
   subtract 60 and add one hour to the final time:  75 - 60 = 15. If you got
   one extra minute on point 5, you have to add this. I did, so I've got 16
   minutes, and 1 hour to be added to the final time. 

8. Take the hours from the time after Bizarro and add one if you got one extra
   hour on point 7. I did, so I've got 9 hours. Then add the minutes from point
   7 and seconds from point 6.  9:16:05

9. Add the PAL Gamer Penalty of 5:37. First add the minutes.  16 + 5 = 21. If
   this number exceeds 60, you simply subtract 60 and add an hour. Then add the
   seconds.  5 + 37 = 42.  Same deal if this number exceeds 60. Subtract 60 and
   add a minute. Then you have the final time.  9:21:42.



                                   The Result
                                  ############

My final time: 8:57:59

My goal for this test run was to beat the game in less than nine hours and as
you can see, I made it.

That's all, folks. The challenge is over. Let's go home proud.

history, credits and some final words. I also moved the record run results here

                           5.1 <> Record Run Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here are all the save times from my best speed run. Take note that these times
were set during a test run, so in some cases you will have no trouble beating
them or gaining time on me. In the beginning, I put some effort into the run,
but after a while, I became more and more reckless and I didn't care if I lost
a second or ten. I actually forgot to pick up the Huge Materia at Fort Condor,
so I had to go back there and get it before entering Mideed for the second
time, something that cost me about two minutes. But since it was only a test
run, I didn't care. Also, I used many of the old strategies in this run and
many of them were much slower than the new ones. As I said in the FAQ section,
you should have no trouble beating my record if you're good, but first timers
will most likely have a hard time. This record will be completely destroyed
when I beat the perfect run.

                            Farringa's PC Record Run
                           ##########################

Farringa just completed his PC run and he ended up beating lolo's time with
more than 40 minutes! Not because lolo did a bad job on his run, but that was
almost two years ago and the strategies were very outdated. Farringa has been
using the new strategies from the very beginning and the fact that he totally
crushed lolo's record just shows how much better the new strategies are.

As a matter of fact, he didn't put that much effort into his run until Cosmo
Canyon and he was actually 3 minutes behind lolo's time at that point. In other
words, you shouldn't have any trouble beating his times up to Cosmo Canyon if
you put some effort into it. After that, it will get tougher. In any case, I
wish you good luck if you want to try and beat it.

If you can prove that you have beaten this record, and you have all the save
times, I will put YOUR record here.

                              5.2 <> Contacting Me
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you need to contact me, you can send an email to garlandg@online.no. You can
ask me anything regarding Speed Runs, other challenges or FFVII in general, but
don't bother asking me simple questions that can easily be found in the FAQs.
Also let me know if you find typos, grammar errors or bad language that must be
corrected. English is still my second language after all. Just be aware that
I'm a busy (read: lazy) man and it might take a while before I reply.

Any tips or suggestions for the guide are appreciated, but professionals only.
Don't send me a mail unless you know what you're talking about. And don't
bother asking me how the hell it's possible to beat the game this fast. It's
possible. Do you honestly think I've spent hundreds of hours writing a joke
FAQ? If you don't believe me, you can read the FAQ or you can start a Speed Run
yourself. By following the FAQ, you should be able to beat the game in less
than 12 hours, even if you've only beaten the game once. You might end up
having fun. I highly recommend it if you think FFVII is too easy.

You can find me on the FFVII message board as well. I'm not very active, but as
long as I'm doing the perfect run, you can find me in the Speed Run Discussions
Topic. Stop by and post if you're planning to do a Speed Run. You can also find
me on Youtube, where I upload videos of my perfect run as I progress, as well
as other FFVII challenge videos.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            5.3 <> Version History
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Simply a list over current and earlier versions of the guide. The current
version is always at the top.


Version 3.3 -> March 26th, 2010 (261 kB)
----------------------------------------
Added a few more questions in the FAQ section (1.4). Apparently, I also made
some other changes during the past three years, as the file was 259 kB before I
added the question, but I have no idea what. Not that it matters much.


Version 3.2 -> June 11th, 2007 (256 kB)
---------------------------------------
Farringa has completed his PC run and crushed lolo's record, so I replaced his
record times with Farringa's. As of right now, he has submitted his run to SDA,
but it will take a while before it's available. When it is, I will update the
FAQ with a link to it in the Intro section (1.2). In addition to that, I added
a link to my Youtube channel, where I upload videos of my perfect run as I
progress. You can find the link to the channel in section 1.2 and 5.2. I also
added a video of the marching and fixed a few small mistakes and typos.

Fun fact: The FAQ has almost grown twice as big since the first version! :D


Version 3.1 -> May 10th, 2007 (255 kB)
--------------------------------------
This is the completed version of the new guide. The main differences are some
new strategies, some new videos and the addition of the videos that were
missing in the last version. I also fixed some mistakes and typos.


Version 3.0 -> April 9th, 2007 (245 kB)
---------------------------------------
This is the major update I promised in Version 2.2.1. Originally, my goal was
to complete it before the end of November 2005, but that couldn't be done. Not
because I was lazy, but because the Speed Run discussions were far from over.
Then, in July 2006, lolo finally completed his testing and I could finally
finish the FAQ. However, things kept coming in the way, so I couldn't complete
the FAQ until the end of the year. In fact, I completed it only 25 minutes
before midnight on New Year's Eve. That's because I was lazy. I'll admit that.

However, I couldn't submit it to GameFAQs just yet. First, I had to let lolo go
through the FAQ to find typos and other things to fix. Then I had to fix all
the stuff he pointed out, have him proofread it again and fix the things he
pointed out again. After some more testing and a final proofread, the FAQ was
completely done and I could submit it to GameFAQs.

So, what's the big difference from the last version? Well, the FAQ has been
entirely re-written and hardly anything remains from the last version. The
most important difference is, of course, the fact that the entire run has been
improved to a maximum. You can achieve a much better result with this new FAQ.
In fact, only a few bosses use the same strategy as last time. I also added the
Perfect Run section and moved the Record Run section to the Additional Info
part of the guide.

I decided to submit the FAQ to GameFAQs on April 9th, as I saw no point in
waiting any longer. A few things are still missing, like videos for some of the
last battles, but they will be added once lolo finds some time to record them.


Version 2.99 -> December 31st, 2006 (226 kB)
--------------------------------------------
I finished the new FAQ, but there were still things I needed to fix before I
submitted it to GameFAQs.


Version 2.2.2 -> August 3rd, 2005 (186 kB)
------------------------------------------
Fixed a couple of mistakes. Thanks to Squire636 for pointing them out. I also
made a few small changes in the guide.


Version 2.2.1 -> June 6th, 2005 (186 kB)
----------------------------------------
Corrected TONS of typos and some grammar mistakes. There will be a major update
some time in the future.


Version 2.2 -> January 4th, 2005 (186 kB)
-----------------------------------------
Here we are again. Bergqvist discovered that FMVs are shown at the same speed
in any version of the game, so I had to make some changes again. I also got
some useful info on Sephiroth from Terence that allowed me to make an easier
strategy, and I corrected some typos and grammar mistakes.


Version 2.1 -> July 25th, 2004 - (177 kB)
-----------------------------------------
Bergqvist reminded me of why the PAL game is slower, and I quickly had to
change some important things. Calculating the final time got way easier.


Version 2.0 -> July 24th, 2004 - (177 kB)
-----------------------------------------
I promised a re-write in Version 1.0, and I started working on this only two
days after the completion of that version. This version was far more detailed
and many bosses had better and faster strategies.


Version 1.0 -> July 8th, 2004 - (134 kB)
----------------------------------------
The first version of the guide. Pretty simple, but good enough for a first
timer. After re-writing the guide twice, I have to admit that this version was
very embarrassing. Thankfully, it was only available for 16 days. I still have
it stored on my computer, though, so let me know if you want to see it.

                                5.4 <> Credits
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Giving credits to whoever helped out is a golden rule here on GameFAQs and here
is the section where that will be done. I would like to thank the following:


lolo26
------
I think it's safe to say that he is the one who has done the most for the Speed
Runs during these years. Since he joined the Speed Run discussions, he's come
up with tons of ideas and strategies and he's probably spent more time testing
stuff than the rest of us together. He's the mastermind behind the so-called
"Tifa-san plan" and many of the strategies we use today are made by him. He's
also proofread all the versions of the FAQ several times. Also, for recording
videos for all the battles.


KADFC
-----
KADFC made the "Low Level Game" topic, where the Speed Run discussions started.
He was the first person to test my guide and he came up with some ideas during
his run that we are still using today.


Bergqvist
---------
This Swedish guy was the third person to join the Speed Run discussion and also
the third person to test the first version of this guide. He didn't come up
with that many ideas during his two runs, but he was the guy who discovered
that FMVs are run at the same speed in different versions of the game.


BrutalAl
--------
Another Swedish guy. He joined the Speed Run discussions in 2005 and he's done
A LOT for the Speed Runs since then. This includes A LOT of testing and he's
come up with many brilliant ideas. He also deserves credit for the "Tifa-san
plan", as he was the one who lead the way with the entire Deathblow-Death
Sentence-Powersoul issue. He did some of the videos too. He also came up with
the "Wait Trick" that made some late disc 2 battles easier.


Terence
-------
The AI information in his Enemy Mechanics FAQ is always useful and some of the
strategies wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for his work.


Farringa
--------
This guy has been using the new guide since the very beginning and he's pointed
out a lot of stuff that needed to be fixed. He also discovered a random battle
problem in the PC version and he also found a solution for it. See the FAQ
section (1.4) for details.

In addition to this, he also has the best speed run record with the PC version.
He totally crushed lolo's old record of 8:22:03 when he used the new strategies
in his run. Therefore, you will now find Farringa's PC times in the Record Run
section (5.1) now. He also submitted his run to SDA and I posted a link to it
in the intro section (1.2).


Squire636, whitehelm, eo31459, Ekudeht:
---------------------------------------
For suggestions and/or pointing out mistakes and typos in the guide.


Defcon999
---------
For informing me that where you place the Midgar Parts on the model determines
which chest opens next.


Squaresoft
----------
For creating many of my favorite games. Keep up the good work!


CJayC and Gamefaqs
------------------
CJayC created GameFAQs, the best place to go when you're stuck in a game, if
you need tips or strategies or just want to discuss a game with people from all
around the world. This FAQ would most likely not exist if CjayC hadn't created
GameFAQs. Of course, GameFAQs wouldn't exist today without all the contributors
either, so thanks to everybody who put a lot time and effort into making all
the FAQs.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                               5.5 <> Final Words
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section will be left open until I beat the perfect run. For now, I'll just
end the FAQ with Barret's famous quote:


There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
