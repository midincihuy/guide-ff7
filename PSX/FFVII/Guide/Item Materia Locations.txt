There's no better guide on this site to find what
you need in FFVII than right here. Plus, after seeing another
FAQ on this site, and having to exit out because of its size,
I've decided to attempt and break it down into 
reasonable data size.

*To stock up on Elixirs, just talk to the leader and skip placing diggers and
igniting bombs, until you have to mark the spot. Now, do you see the F-16
aircraft? The nose of it lies on the ground. Position Cloud so his touches
the top of the aircraft's nose. This is the place you want to dig for many
Elixirs. Mark it, and check the chest afterwards. Nothing in it? Don't
worry.. there won't be an Elixir in it every single time. Your chances of
getting an Elixir are about 1 out of 7 tries. I find it fairly decent, 
especially seeing how an Elixir is a rare item, and getting so many of them
now already isn't donw very often. Don't forget to skip placing diggers, as
you don't need them to find the spot. Enjoy yourself.. when you're done,
enter the Sleeping Forest.

by 1/8th, maximum of 6000
              15/256 chance of highest of Parents' Max Run decreased by
                                        1/20th, minimum of 1
             161/256 chance of average of Parents' Max Run

  Run      : Average of Parent's Run

  Stamina  : 175/256 chance of highest of Parents' Stamina increased by
                                        1/20th, maximum of 9999
              81/256 chance of average of Parents' Stamina

  If a Gold Chocobo was born (see below for what causes this) and 
the average of the Parents' Max Dash is less than 5000, then the 
following 'bonuses' will be applied:

        7/16: Max Dash is set to 5000
        2/16: Max Dash is set to 5100
        2/16: Max Dash is set to 5200
        1/16: Max Dash is set to 5300
        1/16: Max Dash is set to 5400
        2/16: Max Dash is set to 5500
        1/16: Max Dash is set to 5950

    After this bonus, the Max Dash is further modified:
           x = [Random(0..255) / 10]
          50% chance that Max Dash is increased by 'x'
               otherwise, Max Dash is decreased by 'x'

  Otherwise (the baby is not a Gold Chocobo or the average Max 
Dash was greater or equal to 5000):
      55/256: The baby's Max Dash will be set to the highest of the 
Parents' Max Dash increased by 1/10th, maximum of 6000
     201/256: The baby's Max Dash will be set to the average of the 
Parents' Max Dash


  If the Chocobo's Max Run is greater or equal to its Max Dash, then 
Max Run is reduced by 100 repeatedly until it is lower than Max Dash.

  If a Gold Chocobo was born and its Max Run is less than 4000, 
then it gets a bonus of 1000 to its Max Run.  This can potentially 
cause it to go above Max Dash.

  Finally, if the baby Chocobo's Run is greater or equal to its Max 
Run, the Run value is reduced by 100 repeatedly until it is lower 
than Max Run.

                               Races Won by the parents add up to 12 or more

           If you get a Gold Chocobo by this method, then it will have a
             Rating of Great
              
    If you don't get an automatic Gold Chocobo or aren't mating a 
Black and a Wonderful Chocobo in the first place, then you have a 
50% chance of the father's color and a 50% chance of the mother's 
color

    Under those circumstances, there's a 50/50 chance it'll get either 
the father's or the mother's Rating

        2/16: Max Dash is set to 4500

    After this bonus, the Max Dash is further modified:
           x = [Rnd(0..255) / 5]
          50% chance that Max Dash is increased by 'x'
               otherwise, Max Dash is decreased by 'x'

  Otherwise (the baby is not a Black Chocobo or the average Max 
Dash was greater or equal to 4000):

Parents' Max Dash increased by 1/10th, maximum of 6000
     196/256: The baby's Max Dash will be set to the average of the 
Parents' Max Dash

  If the Chocobo's Max Run is greater or equal to its Max Dash, then 
Max Run is reduced by 100 repeatedly until it is lower than Max Dash.

  Finally, if the baby Chocobo's Run is greater or equal to its Max 
Run, the Run value is reduced by 100 repeatedly until it is lower 
than Max Run.

    If a Blue and a Green Chocobo are being mated, then:
        If the total number of races won by its parents is 9 or more, then
          the baby is automatically a Black Chocobo
        If it's less than 9:

                  128/256 chance: Blue Chocobo
                  118/256 chance: Green Chocobo
        The baby's Rating will be either Great (50%) or Good (50%)

    Otherwise, if both of the parents are Great or Good Chocobos:
        If the total number of races won by the parents is 4 or more, then
          the baby is automatically either a Blue (50%) or Green (50%)

        The Rating of the newborn Chocobo will be Great if both 
parents have the same Rating, and will have an equal chance of 
Great or Good if the parents were of different Ratings

    If the *first* Parent you picked was a Great or Good Chocobo, 
but the second isn't, then there's a 25% chance that it won't matter, 
and it'll use the above condition (both parents are Great/Good) to 
work out Color and Rating.  The Rating of the newborn in this case 
will be the same as the first Parent

    If *everything else* fails, then the baby will be a Yellow Chocobo, 
and have a 50/50 chance of getting either its mother's or its father's
      Rating

    until it is lower than Max Dash
  If Max Run is greater than or equal to Max Dash, subtract 100 
    from it until it is lower than Max Dash
  If Run is greater than or equal to either Dash or Max Run, 
    subtract 100 from it until it is lower than both

  If the baby chocobo's Max Dash is under 4000, there is a 1/512 
chance that a bonus will be applied to the Chocobo's Dash 
stats, using the following:

                       1/128: Max Dash is set to 4000
                       1/128: Max Dash is set to 4100
                       2/128: Max Dash is set to 4200
                       3/128: Max Dash is set to 4300
                       1/128: Max Dash is set to 4500
                     120/128: No change to Max Dash

Its Dash is then set to its Max Dash, and then 6 random 
numbers each between 0 and 255 (Rnd(0..255)) are subtracted 
from it.  That means that it could end up anywhere between 0 
to 1530 beneath your Max Dash.

Special Info on Death Penalty (courtesy of Tyrant_Wave):



DP's Attack Formula:
Power = [Power * [Vincent's Kills / 128] / 16] + 10

The second Power = 16 for normal attack, 2 for morph.

Then go from a normal attack there onwards.

Also remember to add in defence and other such factors afterwards.

Check the Battle Mechanics FAQ for more info.


//OVERFLOW INFO//

First off, once you hit 65535 kills, it doesn't increase anymore. 
There's no overflow *there*.

You don't need to do 22 million damage to cause an overflow. There are 
two main dangers where overflow can occur. The first is right at the start 
where your Base Damage is applied to both the Power of the attack and the 
enemy's Defense. If this damage goes above 262,144 damage, an overflow 
will occur.

The second danger occurs right when Random Variance is worked out which 
is after all the things like Berserk, Frog, Critical Hits and the 
like have been added. If the damage before Random Variance 
goes above a random value from 524288 to 559094, the damage 
will overflow.

If the damage overflows (and assuming that it doesn't overflow by enough to go 
back into positive numbers again - that *can* happen with low enough Defense 
and high enough Power/Hero Drinks), the damage will be negative.

Negative damage is not the same as positive healing. Negative damage makes FF7 
think: "Oh, you did so much damage that his HP overflowed and he now has more 
HP than before the attack. I'd better fix that." Instant death.


**You can visit Lucrecia anytime, leave and fight ten battles,
then return to get Chaos and Death Penalty (info from
AdamantBarrage)
**The more enemies Vincent has killed with 
this weapon equipped, the
more damage it will do. But beware: there is a 
bug that, if you kill too many
enemies, the damage overflow will hurt Vincent.

Yes, I know. There's plenty of other places that you can find this. However,
to add to this guide, and for more completionist purposes, this section is
here to help with Perfect Games!


For a list of what's misseable, check the List of Misseable Items and 
Materia [LOMIAM] section!





A) The Most Important Things


Here's a few things to keep in mind while attempting a Perfect Game:



I) Expect this to take a long time.....an extremely long time! I'm talking about
350-400 hours if you're attempting to get 99 of everything, and even more
if you're attempting max EXP, max stats, and max Natural HP/MP for everyone
(more likely about a year or so on that). 

II) Make sure that you've grabbed EVERYTHING from an area! Check the
Item/Equipment/Materia Locations (By Area) [IEML] section for a layout
(and checklist) of everything in a specific area! Also make sure to buy
99 of everything that you can BEFORE moving on in the game, since you 
can't grab them again after a certain point. These includes:


Iron Bangles (Get 99 before getting on the train)
Four Slots (Get before end of disc 1)
Shotgun (Get before end of disc 1)
Ghost Hands (Steal at least 2 if you're going to use the W-Item trick, or
steal/win 99 before going to Sector 7 Pillar)
Vagyrisk Claw (Steal before getting to Level 78)
Reflect Ring (Steal 99 before destroying Ultimate Weapon, or forcing 
Ultimate Weapon to stop at Cosmo Canyon)
Shinra Beta (Steal 99 before fighting Jenova-Birth)
Shinra Alpha (Steal 99 before fighting Hojo)

III) Keep multiple saves of course! You never know when you might screw
up and miss something that you don't want to miss!


_____________________________________________________


B) Perfect Game Levels


Yes, everyone has a different view of what a Perfect Game is. Some think
beating the game and beating the WEAPONs is perfect, while others (such
as I) believe having max of everything is perfect. This little section here
describes each level of perfection (based off of JungleJim's faq), with 
details of the levels. Note that I'll tend to change the levels here, but
keep in mind that these AREN'T definite. These are all up to how the
player views a Perfect Game. Also note that you can't just change levels
halfway through the game due to a lot of things not being available after
certain points:



Level 0

-Beat the game


*Easiest level, and one that everyone can do without any problems. Nothing
special here at all.




Level 1

-Buy Costa del Sol villa
-Get all limit breaks
-Get Yuffie and Vincent


*This is something that really shouldn't be hard at all, and isn't too much 
of a step up from Level 0 at all.....in fact, you can pretty much put this and 
Level 0 in the same category, since there's nothing hard at all about it.




Level 2

-Defeat Ultimate, Emerald, and Ruby Weapon


*This is where it might get a little harder for most people if they're not used
to the game. Ultimate Weapon shouldn't be a problem at all, but Emerald
and Ruby will be for those who've never fought them or don't know how
to beat them. However, this is still rather easy for those who know what
they're doing.




Level 3

-One of each materia mastered
-All characters are at Level 99
-Complete all sidequests
-Everyone's Grudge does 9999 to each character
-Full set of chocobos
-Chocobo Sage tells you everything



*The more time consuming stuff starts here more than anything. The materia
will be the downfall here, since there's several you can miss permanently,
so you really have to start looking out for them in order to not fail this level
off the bat. Sidequests are also another thing that's kinda easy to screw up
on (particularly the Fort Condor sidequest). For the Chocobo Sage, Everyone's
Grudge, and Level 99 bit, these are just nothing but time and effort. For
the full set of Chocobos bit, this differs from player to player. One of 2
possibilites exist for this, being:


1) Having 7 Gold Chocobos
2) Having a Gold, Green, Blue, Black, Wonderful, and 3 Gold Chocobos.


***NOTE: For Everyone's Grudge, the formula is Damage=10 x the number
of enemies that character has killed.***





Level 4

-At least one of every item/weapon/armor/accessory
-Max stats for every character


*More time consuming stuff. The items shouldn't be a problem to get 99
of if you use the W-Item glitch; otherwise, it will take a while to get. This is
also a very easy one to fail if you don't watch for where everything is, since
this game has a lot of one-time only items, which also includes Key items, 
being:




[Items]

Battery
Earth Mallet
Catastrophe
Earth Mallet




[Key Items]

Coupon A
Coupon B
Coupon C
Membership Card
Bikini Briefs/Lingerie
Glass/Ruby/Diamond Tiara
Cologne/Flower Cologne/Sexy Cologne
Deodorant/Digestive/Disinfectant
Pharmacy Coupon
Leviathan Scales





[Weapons]


Rising Sun
Yoshiyuki
Max Ray
Pile Banger
Missing Score
Master Fist
Umbrella
Princess Guard
Behemoth Horn
Shotgun (only if you don't buy them before the end of disc 1)
HP Shout
Starlight M-Phone
Battle Trumpet
Grow Lance
Spirit Lance






[Armor]

Aegis Armlet
Mystile
Warrior Bangle
Shinra Alpha
Shinra Beta
Ziedrich
Minerva Band
Four Slots (Only if you don't buy before the end of Disc 1)






[Accessories]

Curse Ring
Touph Ring
Reflect Ring
Poison Ring










Max stats is easy really, since you can use the Gelinka to morph for the
sources you need.





Level 5

-Max of all items/weapons/armor/accessories
-Max EXP for each character
-Max Gil




Why is this Level 5? Simple....for the fact that Max exp and gil will take
FOREVER to get.....considering that they go well above 100,000,000 each.
The theory is that 999,999,999 is the max for both of these.


The max of all items/weapons/armor/accessories will also be very time
consuming, considering some of the things that you need 99 of are either
hard to obtain due to luck (Gold Saucer items) or you have to steal/win them
from enemies. Also note that these include Key items as well!
