*******************************************************************************

Hello! And, welcome to my Chocobo guide. I have decided to take on writing this
guide because I have noticed several of the same questions coming up on the
GameFAQs Final Fantasy VII message board related to Chocobo breeding and rais-
ing. After doing a little research for myself and listening to the comments
from the other users, I realized that the information in the other Chocobo FAQs
on the site is not completely accurate. Using those guides will result in
breeding a Gold Chocobo, but following them will also result in a loss of a lot
of time and money (gil that is, not cash money).

My plan was to make a guide that provides the answers to breeding a Gold Cho-
cobo the fastest and cheapest way possible. I had also hope to be able to pro-
vide a little extra information about Chocobos and their place in Final
Fantasy VII. It has since become a guide that (as far as I have found) is the
most comprehensive Chocobo guide available. I've tried to add as much informa-
tion on Chocobos as I can find to truly make this a one-stop Chocobo guide.

Let it be known that I have nothing but respect for the authors of the other
guides on the site. At one time, I believed that the techniques they de-
scribed were 100% correct, and it is now known that is not true. Those guides
will lead to Gold Chocobos, but the method described in this guide is better.

If you're having a particular problem with breeding or raising Chocobos, check
out the Frequently Asked Questions portion at the end of this guide ([g30]).
The questions in that section are listed at the start of this guide ([faq]). I
will have many of the questions that I've seen on the message boards several
times answered in that section. The main body of the guide answers these quest-
ions, but the FAQ section has shorter, more to-the-point answers.

I thank you for taking the time to check out this guide. I hope you enjoy it,
and I hope it helps.

*                         [a02] How to use this guide                         *
*******************************************************************************

I have tried to set this guide up so it will be easy to find the information
for which you are looking.

If you are looking for the quickest way to breed a certain color of Chocobos or
any other information in particular, simply highlight the corresponding label
listed in the Table of Contents ([toc]), press ctrl+C (on a PC) to copy,
ctrl+F to bring up your "find" browser and ctrl+V to paste the label in the
"find" box. Hit enter, and you're on your way to the right area (hopefully).

I have redesigned the sections and assigned the sections into chapters, which
(I think) weill help you find whatever it is for which you are looking fairly
easily.

I started with (of course) the Table of Contents, which should serve as a
quick reference to anyone looking for something in specific. The second section
includes a list of the questions answered in the Frequently Asked Questions
section at the end of the guide (section [g30]).

Each of the following chapters of this guide begins with a header. These head-
ers will act as a quick reference point for each section.

The current chapter of the guide is the "A" section. This section is all of the
introductory information about the guide and all of the legal mumbo-jumbo.

The "B" chapter is the quick reference guide to Breeding a Gold Chocobo. This
chapter contains the quickest ways to breed. Just a little piece of advice: if
you're using the "No-Race-Required" Method outlined in sectoin [b04], it is
best to start from scratch. Do not come into the middle of the process and
think you will be able to pick it up half way, as it will not  work that way.
This chapter also contains information on how to work with the game's Chocobo-
Breeding, Random-Number Generator

The "C" chapter acts as kind of the header for the meat of this guide. It
starts the break down of all the Chocobo-related information I can find.

The "D" chapter addresses the basic information about catching, keeping and
basic Chocobo care.

The "E" chapter discusses the racing of Chocobos. At this time, the information
I have on hand about the actual races is a little sparse, but that has become
my primary goal for the next update. This section also explains the stats of a
Chocobo.

The "F" chapter handles the information about the diferent types of Chocobos
and how to acquire them, whether that be through catching or breeding. This
section also has the stat properties listed for the different Nuts.

The "G" chapter is anything else that I could think of to add to the guide that
doesn't really belong anywhere else. It contains the FAQ section, the informa-
tion on the Chococo Sage and the Chocobo Family as well as other little tidbits
of information that I have gathered.

If you're just looking for the quickest way to breed a Gold Chocobo, highlight
[b02], press ctrl+C, ctrl+F and ctrl+V to go straight to the "Breeding a Gold
Chocobo" section of the guide. If you need a little extra help with how the
process works, read the entire "B" section.

It has come to my attention that reading this guide has become longer than the
actual process of breeding a Gold Chocobo using the methods decribed. So, I
have taken strides in making the information flow a little better and help eas-
ier to find.

*******************************************************************************
*                   [a03] Quick Note of PSN Version for PSP                   *
*******************************************************************************

First, be aware that the PSN version of this (and all PSOne Classics) is the
exact same game as the original, whether you play it on the PSP or the PS3.

There will be a few mentions throughout this guide of using the R2 and L2 but-
tons for different things. If you own one, you know the PSP doesn't have R2
and L2 buttons. However, the analog stick on the PSP (the "nub") is not used
for playing Final Fantasy VII, as the analog stick was not used for the origin-
al game. To use your R2 and L2 buttons while playing this on your PSP, your
"nub" has been assigned the roles of L2, R2 and L2+R2 by pressing left, right
and up respectively by default.

I have received a few e-mails from readers who have let me know that the PSPGo
operates the same way a original PSP operates. I don't have any personal exper-
ience with the PSPGo, so I will take their word. :)

Also, I have noticed there is a slight difference in the way you reset the
game. If you choose either the "Reset game" or the "Quit game" option under
the "Home" menu (by pushing the "Home" button), it will perform a "hard reset".

The only way I know to perform a "soft reset" on the PSP is to hold the L and R
buttons, hold up on the "nub" and push start and select and the same time.

*******************************************************************************
*                   [a04] Quick Note on PSN version for PS3                   *
*******************************************************************************

Again, be aware that the PSN version of this (and all PSOne Classics) is the
exact same game as the original, whether you play it on the PSP or the PS3.

The only thing of notice here is the way you reset the game. If you choose
either the "Reset game" or the "Quit game" option under the "Home" menu (by
pushing the PS button), it will perform a "hard reset".

Again, the only way that I have figured to perform a "soft reset" is to hold
the four shoulder buttons and push select and start at the same time.

This doesn't make a big difference for overall game play, but if you're trying
to work with the RNG (which is known to be a bit of a mess for this game), it
makes a world of difference.

If there are any questions, concerns or comments pertaining to this guide, feel
free to let me know via e-mail. The address is gamefaqsuser30@sbcglobal.net. I
also still browse the Final Fantasy VII message board on gamefaqs.com with some
regularity, and I'm always looking for ways to help other users, especially
with Chocobos.

If you read though this guide and it has helped you or if you just enjoyed it,
please just shoot me a short e-mail if you would like. Writers on this site
don't get paid for what we do to help other gamers, and sometimes it's nice
just to receive a short "Thanks". :)

                finding typos and grammar errors. Started making preparations
                for the Chocobo Racing section and re-organization of the
                guide. Noticed a couple of instances where it was still men-
                tioned that fighting random battles advances the RNG markers
                and made appropriate changes. Added ChocoBuckle Section. Add-
                ed Section on Run Type/Personality and some more information on
                the stats of the Chocobos you catch on the World Map. This was
                the largest update I had done in a while, so I hope everything
                looks good.

                Finished June 10, 2010

Version 1.6.0 - Added the sections on the Chocobo Sage and the Chocobo Ranch
-------------   Family. Fixed a couple of grammar issues and re-worded a few
                things for clarity (for my sake). Thanks to KingTrode for
                pointing out some unclear spots and making some recommendations
                Added the "Myths Dispelled" section. Added the Quick Notes for
                PSN - PSP/PS3 section.

                The next update will be a large "renovation" of the guide. I
                will be re-organizing the sections to make it a little more
                user-friendly (hopefully). It's going to look a lot different,
                and I am hoping a lot better.

                Finished July 8, 2010

Version 2.0.0 - The first "major" revision the guide has seen. I re-organized
-------------   a majority of the guide to help it flow better. I also renum-
                bered the sections. They are now designed that each chapter has
                a kind of "purpose". I have begun working on gathering stats
                and information about the actual races. Hopefully soon, I'll
                have a section devoted to helping users win races. I also added
                and changed quite of bit of text. I have verified and corrected
                some of the information concerning the types of Yellow Chocobos
                and where they're caught.

                I have now started researching the PC version for any differ-
                ences in it. I am also examining the possibility of creating an
                HTML format of this guide to be hosted on a personal site, and
                I am also looking at potentially developing this guide into some
                form of application for mobile devices (iPhone, Android, etc.).

It was tough getting this guide accepted. However, since it has been accepted,
the updates have started and will continue to come as I have time. I am working
on some other projects, but I do believe this guide still answers a majority of
the questions that I've seen arise. If there are any others, please e-mail me
or ask on the GameFAQs Final Fantasy VII Message Board. There are many users
ready, willing and able to help.

*******************************************************************************

I know most people wait until the end of their guides and FAQs to thank the 
people they want to thank, but I'm going to do it right from the get go. If
there is anyone that believes they deserve to be thanked, please let me know.

First, I'd like to thank my lovely wife. I know I've spent what seems like end-
less hours at the computer looking up information for this guide and typing it
out, but I want you to know that I'm very thankful to have a wife who under-
stands my desire to do this. I love you!

Thanks to phiefer3 - your dedication to making sure the board users know how to
properly breed their Chocobos is what lead me to design this guide. I also use
a lot of the information I have picked up from you in this guide.

Thanks to shadow666 - you have also helped clarify breeding mechanics to me,
and your link (shadow.thebrink.us/Chocobobreeding.html) has provided me with a
great deal of information.

Thanks to Absolute Steve - for allowing me the use of information from your
guide to make sure this is the most accurate Chocobo guide on the site. Not to
mention your guide has been a great deal of help to me and many other users
during its life on this site.

Thanks to Terence (TFergusson) - for cracking the codes of this game to make
the actual mechanics behind Chocobo breeding available to us all. Also for
allowing me to use your information in my guide.

Thanks to BrutalAl - for further explaining/clarifying the Random Number
Generator issues many users have. Also for your video on quickly breeding a
Gold Chocobo using the glitch you discovered and RNG manipulation. Finally,
Thank you for providing the information for the "No-Race-Required" Method of
breeding a Gold Chocobo.

A big thank you to all of those who have e-mailed me or contacted me on
GameFAQs.com's Final Fantasy VII message board with corrections and clarifica-
tions. I'm only one person, and I am human. So, I know I miss a lot of mistakes
when I read over my own work. Thank you for helping me clear up my guide, so it
really can help the biggest number of users. A few of these folks are: Diamond
Weapon, Scott, Taurevo, Thillbilli and KingTrode. I'm sorry if I've not listed
you as someone who has contacted me and you have.

Thanks to you, the reader. Without you, there is no reason to write guides. I
am doing this as a labor of love, because I love Final Fantasy VII and all as-
pects of it.

Thanks to GameFAQs.com and its administrative staff for finding this guide
worthy of being on your site and continuing to host it.

And, of course, Thanks to SquareSoft (now Square-Enix) for producing Final
Fantasy VII and the entire Final Fantasy series. In my humble opinion, it is a
true masterpiece of a game and series that has withstood the test of time.

*******************************************************************************

I think this is a pretty good time to mention the Random Number Generator (or
RNG) as I will mention it many times throughout the guide. The RNG can be your
friend or your enemy when it comes to breeding. It can be a lot friendlier if
you know how to work it a little bit, and here's a little help with that.

For those who do not know, computers are incapable of picking completely random
numbers, so computer programmers have designed a Random Number Generator. This
is a set sequence of "random" numbers on which "Markers" are placed The Markers
move along the RNG using set actions as triggers to advance. The RNG in Final
Fantasy VII actually uses several Markers. The Marker for breeding, raising and
moving Chocobos is separate from the other Markers in the game (such as random
battles and other "random" events).

The game does not maintain the position of each Marker on your save file. They
are contained in the system itself while the system is on. If you perform a
"hard reset" (pushing the "reset" button or powering the system off), the
Marker's position will reset to the initial position (zero). If you perform a
"soft reset" (Pressing and holding the four shoulder buttons, select and start
at the same time) the Marker will maintain its position.

Here's a quick look at the basics of how an RNG and its Markers work.

Think about the series of numbers from 1-10. Most people would count those num-
bers "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10". The RNG rearranges the numbers in a set
pattern. As an example, we'll say the pattern is "2, 5, 8, 1, 4, 7, 10, 3, 6,
9". Every time you perform some type of Chocobo-related action (feed a Chocobo
a green, mate Chocobos, move in to or out of the Stables.), the Chocobo Marker
advances a set number of spaces. The Marker also advances on its own while
you're standing outside of the Chocobo Stables on the ChocoFarm. The Marker ad-
vances at a rate of about once per second while you’re standing on the farm
(the screen showing the pen) but not in the stables (the screen with the kids).
For the sake of our example to keep things simple, we'll say the Marker always
advances one space for each thing that triggers an advance. 

I always say that while working with Chocobos (as well as many other aspects of
this game) it's best to save very often. I recommend saving every time right 
before going into the ChocoStables. This way, if you don't get what you're try-
ing to get, you can reset and try again.

Let's say (for the sake of this discussion) that the numbers 1-5 are assigned
to producing Male Chocobos and the numbers 6-10 are assigned to producing Fe-
males. You'd see by my example that the order of breeding would be Male, Male,
Female, Male, Male, Female, Female, Male, Female. If you have bred a Male Cho-
cobo and you need a female, you need to advance the Marker. To do this, as I've
said before, reset the game and reload from the previous save. There are two
possible situations I'll go over - "hard resets" and "soft resets".

"Hard resets"
-------------

After you reload, you'll have to do something different before trying to move
or breed again. A simple thing you can do would be to feed any Chocobo in your
stable any green. This will advance the Marker. You could also just move in and
out of the stable once, as this will also advance the Marker. If you still
don't have what you need, try to reload and do some different things. Normally,
you don't have to reset more than once or twice if you're doing different
things each time.

"Soft resets"
-------------

After you reload from a "soft reset", the Marker will still be in the position
it was before you reset the game. Meaning, once you've tried breeding or moving
a Chocobo, the RNG will advance naturally. Performing a "soft reset" will main-
tain the Marker's naturally advanced position. You shouldn't have to do any-
thing different after reloading to get a different outcome. Again, if it does
not work the first time, "soft reset" and try again.

Of course, the RNG of Final Fantasy VII and its Markers are much more compli-
cated than 1-10 and more things will move it along than the things I've men-
tioned. Some things will even advance it more than one space at a time, but you
can get a general idea of how it's supposed to work from this. I believe the
RNG for this game actually uses 256 Marker locations (0-255 or 00-FF (for those
who use hexidecimal)).

Note: The RNG does not actually mix up the numbers. It simply assigns functions
(gender, color, stats, etc.) to each spot on the line. Real example: for the
breeding for two Great Chocobos with zero wins, RNG position @RNG006 will re-
sult in a Green Male, @RNG008 will result in a Green Female, @RNG034 will re-
sult in a Blue Male, and @RNG005 will result in a Blue Female.

Note: Any time I mention "Manipulating the RNG", I mean using means outside of
the natural flow of the game to gain a desired outcome. Some examples of this
would be to enter and exit the Chocobo Stables or feeding your Chocobos a set
amount of a particular Green to advance the RNG to a desired spot.

*******************************************************************************
*              [b02] Breeding a Gold Chocobo - condensed version              *
*******************************************************************************

Note: This section addresses what I feel is the quickest way to breed a Gold
Chocobo without trying to manipulate the RNG too much.

Also Note: I will mention that I race my Chocobos up to a certain "Class".
A Chocobo's Class has nothing to do with the breeding process. You do not need
to race your Chocobos to a certain Class to guarantee any special breeding
mechanics. I only use the Class as a reference point to know how many races
I've won with a particular Chocobo.

Final Note: It is very possible to breed Special Chocobos without racing. 
Racing only ensures that it will be impossible to receive anything other than
a Special Chocobo when breeding.

Alright, here it is. A quick reference guide to breeding a Gold Chocobo. This
will only be the information needed to guarantee a Gold Chocobo. Mechanics will
be further broken down in the individual sections of the guide, but a lot of
people asked for this to be early in the guide. So, here it is.

Here are the requirements to guarantee a Gold without RNG manipulation:

1) As far as breeding goes Good = Great, so
Good + Good = Great + Great = Good + Great

2) Breed two Good/Great Chocobos with four combined wins with a Carob Nut to
guarantee a Blue/Green.

3) Between three and ten random battles after producing a Chocobo must be
fought to give parent Chocobos proper "rest" time.

4) Mate your two Good/Great Chocobos with a Carob Nut again to get the "opp-
osite" Chocobo from what you bred the first time. Example: your first breeding
produced a Blue Male Chocobo. You need a Green Female. If you don't get what
you need, reset and advance the RNG and try again.

5) Between three and eighteen random battles after a Chocobo has been produced
must be fought before a newborn Chocobo is "old enough" to breed.

6) Breed one Blue Chocobo and one Green Chocobo with nine combined wins with a
Carob Nut to guarantee a Black.

Note: in the following breeding, due to a glitch in the game, you must choose
the Black Chocobo first to receive a Gold.

7) Breed one Black Chocobo with One Wonderful with twelve combined wins with a
Zeio Nut to guarantee a Gold (remembering that you need to fight between three
and eighteen battles before your Black Chocobo is ready).

So, in short:

Good/Great + Good/Great + four wins + Carob Nut = Blue/Green
Blue + Green + nine wins + Carob Nut = Black
Black + Wonderful + twelve wins + Zeio Nut = Gold (Black chosen first)

*******************************************************************************
*               [b03] Breeding a Gold Chocobo - extended version              *
*******************************************************************************

Now for a little deeper explanation to this.

First, buy/rent all six stables and visit the Chocobo Sage to buy about 40-50
Sylkis Greens. Then fly to the area just south of the Bone Village and steal
some (at least three) Carob Nuts from Vlakrados. You can also take some time
here if you so desire to catch a Wonderful Chocobo from the snow fields close
to Icicle Inn (found with one or two jumpings (rabbit looking things)) and
maybe snagging a Zeio Nut from a Goblin on Goblin Island. You’ll need these
things eventually.

Now, catch two Great Chocobos around Mideel. They will always be with one or
two "Spirals". "Spirals" look kind of like purple armidillos.

Quick Side Note: While you're at the Chocobo Sage's House, talk to his Green
Chocobo to receive one of the four "Enemy Skill" Materias, and take a Mimmett
Green to the Chocobo in the shop in Mideel and scratch it behind the ear to
get the "Contain" Materia.

You will need one male and one female. Gender is chosen at the time you move
your Chocobo from the pen outside of the ChocoFarm to the stables inside. For
best results, save before you move any Chocobos from the pen to the stables.
After you move one Chocobo from the pen to the stable, exit the ChocoFarm and
save. After you've saved, return to the stables and move the second Great
Chocobo to the stables. If you got a Chocobo that matches the gender of the
first, do a soft reset (four shoulder buttons, select and start at the same
time) and try again.

Once you have a Great male and Great female, talk to Chole about which Chocobo
is faster and feed that Chocobo about eight to ten Sylkis Greens. Go to the
Gold Saucer and race (and win) four races. Return to the ChocoFarm and breed
your two Greats to produce a Blue/Green Chocobo.

Note: As previously stated, this will also work with Good Chocobos that can be
caught around the Gold Saucer, but Great Chocobos have better base stats. So
they're better racers and will produce better racers. You'll also receive more
experience and AP from the enemy encounters outside of Mideel.

Hang around the ChocoFarm and fight ten random battles. Save your game and
re-enter the ChocoFarm. Breed your two Greats again to produce another
Blue/Green Chocobo. If you do not get the color or gender you needed, do a
"soft reset", reload and try again. The RNG will have moved itself forward from
the previous breeding if you soft reset.

Once you have one Blue and one Green Chocobo and one male and one female, I
recommend feeding the Green Chocobo about ten Sylkis Greens and using that Cho-
cobo to win nine races (This will bring you to the "S-Class" races, but you do
not need to win any of the "S-Class" races). The reason I recommend racing the
Green to nine wins is it's easier to race the Short Track with the Green as it
receives no speed penalty during the "space area" of the track, and the Short
Track takes less time. You'll also only need to feed one Chocobo this way.

Once you have nine combined wins (either all nine with one or a mixture of wins
with both Chocobos - your choice) and have fought some random battles (your
newborn Chocobo won't be able to breed until between three and eighteen battles
have been fought), you're ready to save again and breed your Blue and Green
Chocobos. If you have nine combined wins between your Blue and Green Chocobos
and breed using a Carob Nut, you will get a Black Chocobo.

Again, feed your Black about eight to ten Sylkis Greens and your Wonderful Cho-
cobo about five or six. I usually race my Black Chocobo up to "S-Class" (nine
wins) and my Wonderful up to "B-Class" (three wins). This gives me the twelve
wins required to guarantee a Gold Chocobo.

I always save before breeding, just in case, but once you have twelve combined
wins between your Black and Wonderful, select the Black first and mate usind a
Zeio Nut. This will guarantee a Gold Chocobo.

*                       [b04] "No-Race-Required" Method                       *
*******************************************************************************

Thanks to BrutalAl for the information in this section.

For those that wish to just get in there and breed out a Gold Chocobo, without
all of the hassle of racing, feeding the Chocobos to increase stats, etc., the
following method of breeding a Gold Chocobo is what I'm calling the "No-Race-
Required" Method of breeding. It requires fighting seventeen random battles
(to make sure your Chocobos are "old" enough) and uses the RNG mechanics to
produce the Chocobos needed to receive a Gold.

So, here is the "No-Race-Required" Method with a bit of a break down.

----------------------
BrutalAl's description
----------------------

This is a copy of the post that BrutalAl posted on the GameFAQs message boards.
I will attempt to break this down in a little bit.

Capture 1xGreat, 1xWonderful
@RNG-002 Move Great (F), then (directly after) move Wonderful (M)
@RNG-003 Mate Great+Wonderful = Blue Female
Fight 6x battles
@RNG-052 Mate Great+Wonderful = Green Male
Fight 8x battles
@RNG-007 Mate Blue+Green (Saraha Nut = Black Female
Fight 3x battles
@RNG-008 Mate Black+Wonderful = Gold Female

* "@RNG" = marker's position (000 after hard reset)
* Visiting Choco Farm Field (outdoors) "shortly" increases marker position by
     2, more if you stay longer.
* Feeding Karaka Greens increases the marker by 1 per Karaka Green.
* Mating/Moving increases marker

This requires 0x races and a total of only 17x "Passing-Time" Battles

-------------
The Breakdown
-------------

This will hopefully break down BrutalAl's mechanics to a "read-able" version,
which will require minimal script translation.

The Setup
---------

You will need to have the following for this method:

 - 75,900 gil.
     60,000 gil for the stables
     400 gil for the Saraha Nut (or find one) 
     15,500 gil for the Karaka Greens - less if you want to use the W-Item
          trick/glitch to get the Greens cheaper.
 - All six stable rented
 - A few Reagan Greens to help catching the Chocobos in the field (technically
     two are needed to catch two Chocobos, but if you don't catch the first
     Chocobo you "fight" or you accidently catch a Chocobo you shouldn't have,
     it's nice to have the extras lying around in your inventory.)
 - One Great Chocobo in the pens (caught using the Reagan Greens)
 - One Wonderful Chocobo in the pens (caught using the Reagan Greens)
 - Sixty-two Karaka Greens (this can be different if you use just enter/exit
     the Chocobo Farm Field screen a few times to advance the RNG Markers)
 - Two Carob Nuts
 - One Saraha Nut
 - One Zeio Nut
 - Just a little time. This method is by far the fastest way to breed a Gold
     Chocobo, but you will be required to fight seventeen battles. Where you
     fight these battles is completely up to you. If you want to gain decent AP
     and exp. while not being in any real threatening battles, I recommend the
     forested area around Mideel, but hanging out around the Chocobo Ranch
     works just fine, makes travel quicker and battles very easy.

The Process
-----------

First things first, buy/rent all six stable available for 60,000 gil. If you
want to at this time, go ahead and buy a Saraha Nut and Sixty-two Karaka
Greens. Feeding the Chocobos Greens makes it a little quicker to advance the
RNG since you can feed them multiple greens at one time.

After you have this, it's time to go catch some Chocobos. It's up to you to de-
cide if you want to go catch them north of RocketTown or if you want to go to
Mideel. They both have Great Chocobos, but they seem to show up a little more
regularly outside of Mideel. Catch one Great Chocobo. It will show with two
"Spirals". If the Chocobo you caught does not show with two "Spirals", either
release it or escape from the battle. It'll be useless to you.

Note: If you're still unsure if you have a Great, you can save your game out-
side of the Ranch, move the Chocobo to see if ChocoBilly tells you "This is a
Great Chocobo." and then re-load before going to Icicle Inn. You need to move
both Chocobos in a row for this method to work properly.

As soon as you've caught a Great, go to the Icicle Inn area. Do not move the
Chocobo from the pens to the stables yet. Go to the Chocobo Tracks and catch a
Wonderful Chocobo, which is found with one or two "Jumpings". They looks like
rabbits. Only keep a Wonderful Chocobo. (see the note above if you're not sure
if it's a Wonderful)

Return to the Chocobo Ranch, save and perform a "Hard Reset". This resets the
RNG Markers to their initial position (@RNG-000).

Enter the Chocobo Ranch and quickly make your way into the ChocoStables (if it
takes more than two or three seconds, the RNG will advance further than you
want. You should have two Chocobos in your stables.

Talk to ChocoBilly and select "Moving Chocobos". ChocoBilly will ask you which
Chocobo you would like to move. The first Chocobo that shows up will be the
Great Chocobo that you caught, and ChocoBilly will let you know this by saying,
"This is a Great Chocobo". Select "yes" when he asks if you want to move it
from the pens to the stables. If you have done nothing else since re-loading
after a Hard Reset, the RNG Marker will be at @RNG-002. This will produce a
Great Female Chocobo.

Immediately after moving the Great over, talk to ChocoBilly again and have him
move the Wonderful Chocobo over. When he sees the Wonderful Chocobo, he'll say,
"This... is a Wonderful Chocobo!". If you moved your Great Chocobo at @RNG-002,
the Marker will be at the right spot to give you a Wonderful Male Chocobo.

Now, exit the Chocobo Ranch and save your game. Perform another Hard Reset and
re-load. Re-enter the Chocobo Ranch and quickly make your way to the stables.
Tell Billy you want to feed Chocobos. Feed the Great Chocobo (though it doesn't
matter which one) one Karaka Green to advance the RNG Marker one space. With
the two spaces the Marker advances by entering the Chocobo Ranch Field Screen
and the one space it advances by feeding one Karaka Green, you'll be at
@RNG-003. Talk to Billy and have him mate your Great Chocobo (must be chosen
first) with your Wonderful Chocobo using a Carob Nut. You will receive a Blue
Female Chocobo.

Note: If your total battle count is not equal to 32,767, you will need to go
fight six battles. Save and Hard Reset.

Enter the Chocobo Ranch and quickly make your way to the stables. This time the
RNG Marker needs to get to @RNG-052, and quickly making your way to the stables
screen advanced it to @RNG-002. So, you have the choice of feeding a Chocobo
fifty Karaka Greens (to advance it one space per Green), exiting and entering
the ChocoStables screen twenty-five times (each time you enter the Chocobo
Ranch Field Screen, it advances by two), or a combination of the two. After six
battles and an @RNG-052 position, breed your Great (chosen first) and your Won-
derful with a Carob Nut again to get a Green Male Chocobo.

Once you have your Blue Female and Green Male Chocobos, you must fight eight
battles to get your Chocobos to be "old enough" to breed. Save and Hard Reset.

Enter the ranch and make your way to the stables as usual. To get the proper
Black Chocobo using this method, your Marker needs to be at @RNG-007. You can
get there by entering and exiting the stables a couple of times and feeding one
Karaka Green to a Chocobo or by feeding one Chocobo five Karaka Greens. Breed
the Blue with the Green using a Sahara Nut (not a Carob Nut) to get a Black
Female Chocobo.

Exit the ranch and fight three battles before saving and performing a Hard
Reset (though you can save at any time, and I would advise in doing so).

Enter the ranch and once inside the stables, advance the Marker to @RNG-008 by
exiting and entering the stables three times or feeding one Chocobo six Karaka
Greens. Breed the Black (chosen first) with the Wonderful Chocobo to receive
your very own Gold Female Chocobo.

Well, there you have it. This is a method of breeding a Gold Chocobo using the
Random Number Generator to your advantage. It takes fighting seventeen random
battles (though you can fight more, it won't hurt) and absolutely none of that
racing that some people find so tedious.

Note: When I used this method myself, I started watching the clock in my house
the moment I purchased my first stable (I bought all six at once) and paid at-
tention to the clock the moment my Gold Chocobo was named. Less than forty-five
total minutes had passed. That's catching a Great Chocobo, a Wonderful Chocobo,
fighting the required random battles, saving multiple times and going through
all of the hard resets all within forty-five minutes. That's quite a bit quick-
er than the several hours people used to believe it took to breed a Gold
Chocobo. :)

--------
A Glitch
--------

A breeding glitch has been discovered by BrutalAl when the total number of
battles fought equals 32,767. The glitch causes the number of battles fought
between breeding parent and newborn Chocobos to be obsolete - meaning you would
not have to fight the random battles between breeding to breed again. Using
this information and his own understanding of manipulating the RNG, he bred a
Gold Chocobo in just under four minutes. His work can be seen on YouTube.

Here’s his video. (Hosted by permission from BrutalAl)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZaVmzfmhaBw

Note: the 32,767 battles that would need to be fought would take nearly 200
hours of game play to accomplish (or use a cheat device).

Also Note: the amounts of Greens BrutalAl feeds his Chocobos to manipulate the
RNG is different than listed here. That's because he does not ever reset the
game meaning the RNG Markers are in a different position after each breeding.

Enjoy.

*******************************************************************************

Okay. The first several sections of this guide were simply there for people who
wish to breed a Gold Chocobo in a hurry. The rest of the guide is designed to
break down Chocobos and their mechanics in every way that I can imagine it
being possible.

Chocobos have been in every Final Fantasy game since the second game. To the
best of my knowledge, Chocobos have even appeared in every spin-off Final Fan-
tasy title (Crystal Chronicles, etc.). They even have their own spin-off
series (the Chocobo Fables) and had their own Final Fantasy VIII side game
"Chocobo World" (playable with a pocketstation). They are a mainstay in the
Final Fantasy series and (in my opinion) one of the most recognizable Final
Fantasy icons. They're cute, and everyone should get one. 

One last note, if you're one of the gamers that likes to "customize" their
controllers, set it back to default for all things Chocobo-related. The game is
known to be very "glitchy" when custom controls are used with Chocobos. One of
the most popular problems people have with custom controls is the inability to
move Chocobos from the pens to the stables. So, please, use default controls
for your Chocobos. This will make you and them happy.

*******************************************************************************
*                           [c02] Controlling Chocobos                        *
*******************************************************************************

On the World Map:
-----------------

Chocobos are actually pretty easy to control. You continue to use the direc-
tional pad on your controller to maneuver them. Press the cancel button (de-
fault X) to dismount. Once you start breeding, press confirm (default O) to
mount. All other field/camera controls remain the same.

In the races:
-------------

Directional pad: use to control your Chocobo's movement to the left or right.
     Pressing up or down does nothing special. No, you cannot fly.
X: decreases your running speed. (note: slowing down enough will help to refill
     your stamina bar, albeit slowly.)
Square: increases your running speed. (note: speeding up enough will slowly de-
     crease your stamina bar.)
O (circle): causes your Chocobo to sprint. (note: sprinting quickly drains your
     stamina bar and should not be done for long periods of time.)
Triangle: has no use in Chocobo racing.
Select: switches from "Manual" to "Automatic" control and back again.
Start: Pauses the game.
R1, R2, L1 & L2 by themselves have no use during Chocobo racing - more on that
     later (in the racing section).
Analog Sticks (either on the newer PlayStation controllers or the PS3 DualShock
     controller): has no use in Chocobo racing (or anywhere else in the game.
Analog "Nub" (PSP only): Acts as L2, R2 and L2+R2 by pressing left, right and
     up respectively, which by thelselves do nothing during the races.

That's about it for controlling Chocobos.

*******************************************************************************
*               [c03] What are Chocobos and why do I want them?               *
*******************************************************************************

Chocobos are large chicken-like birds that can be ridden by humans. They are
normally friendly, but they can attack you if you scare them. After they peck
everything in sight, they run. What can I say? They're chickens.

Chocobos have a very important use in this game. They play a part in one of the
longest side quests in the game, and they allow you access to the most powerful
attack in this game that is not a limit break. They also make it possible to 
reach other powerful materia, which will make this game a whole lot easier in
the long run.

Chocobos also have the ability to keep you safe from enemies. While you're rid-
ing on a Chocobo, you will not encounter any random enemies. How cool is that?
However, it should be noted that there are at least three enemies that are vis-
ible on the World Map, which if you come into contact with one of them even
while on a Chocobo, a battle will still commence.

Be careful though, unless you've bought/rented a stable from ChocoBilly (We'll
discuss this later), once you hop off a Chocobo, it'll run and be gone for
good.

*                         [d01] Where can I find them?                        *
*******************************************************************************

There are several locations across the world map where you can find Chocobos.
All you have to do is look at the ground as you explore. Anywhere there are a
bunch of marks on the ground that look like chicken tracks, you've found your-
self a Chocobo area.

There are seven actual places where you can find Chocobos around the world.
They are: the area east of Kalm - by the Chocobo Ranch; the area around Junon;
The area to the northeast of the Gold Saucer; the area to the north of Rocket-
Town; the area on the southern tip of the Wutai continent; the area by Icicle
Inn on the Northern Continent; and the area outside of Mideel on the island in
the southwest corner of the World Map.

*                            [d02] Getting Started                            *
*******************************************************************************

Once you have made it to the point in the game where you can breed Chocobos
(see section [d04]), the first thing you will need to do is make sure you have
plenty of Gil to get started. Getting started isn't really expensive, and you
should have more than enough gil to start by the time you reach this point in
the game.

The first thing I would do is purchase the life-time pass from the Gold Saucer
(if you didn't do it the first time you visited). This will run you 30,000 gil.
You also need to visit the Chocobo Ranch and purchase/rent a couple of stables.
These will cost 10,000 gil a piece, and I would recommend getting all six. You
don't have to do that right away, but it'll make some sense later. Buy at least
four to start though (40,000 gil).

You'll also want to buy some greens to aid in catching Chocobos. I would recom-
mend flying the Highwind to the Northern Continent. Nestled in the mountains on
the north side of the Forgotten City, lies a lonely house. This house belongs
to the Chocobo Sage. A floating blue man who knows a lot about Chocobos but can
never seem to remember too much of the information at once. He also happens to
sell the best greens in the game.

(Side Note: Don't forget to talk to the Chocobo in Chocobo Sage's House. You
receive one of the four "Enemy Skill" Materia for doing so.)

I would buy a few Reagan Greens at 3,000 gil a piece (four or five, maybe), and
I would buy a lot of Sylkis Greens. (Note: if you wait until disc two has
ended, there is a way to "mass-produce" greens and other combat items. It's
called the W-Item Trick/Glitch. I won't explain it here though.) Sylkis Greens
cost 5,000 gil a piece, but they are more than worth it when breeding Chocobos.
You'll probably eventually want to buy at least fifty total Sylkis Greens for
breeding purposes.

There's just a few more things that you'll need to breed - Nuts. You can buy
some nuts from ChocoBilly, but I wouldn't do that. To get the nuts you need,
you gotta go find them.

You'll want to get at least three Carob Nuts. You steal Carob Nuts from an
enemy called "Vlakrados". Vlakrados look kind of like a small dragon. They are
not the easiest enemy in the game with 33,333 hit points. The Carob Nut is also
a drop from the enemy, so if you don't like stealing for moral reasons, you
don't have to.

Note: You can also "purchase" Carob Nuts from the Battle Square at the Gold
Saucer for 500 Battle Points per Nut.

You will also need one Zeio Nut. The Zeio nut is only found in one place in the
world, and that is Goblin Island. Goblin Island is almost due north of the Cho-
cobo Ranch on the "Main" continent and due east of the Chocobo Sage's house on
the Northern Continent. Goblins appear in the forest.

Once you have your life-time pass to the Gold Saucer, some stables, some greens
and some nuts, you're ready to start catching and breeding some Chocobos!

*******************************************************************************
*                          [d03] How do I catch one?                          *
*******************************************************************************

The short answer would be "very carefully".

Actually, you will need a little help with this. Your first step will be to ac-
quire the "Chocobo Lure" Materia. There are two ways to do this. Ideally, you
will want to grab it after you have been to Kalm for the first time. On your
way to the Mythril Mines, stop by the Chocobo Ranch. Speak with ChocoBilly, and
he'll offer you the Chocobo Lure for a small fee (of 2,000 gil). Most likely,
you will need this at this time of the game, since getting across the marsh
which lies to the southwest of the ranch is a little difficult without a Choco-
bo (but possible).

Side Note: During your first trip to the ChocoFarm (and I believe any other
trips there before disc two), you'll notice there are several Chocobos in the
pens in front of the stables. If you approach the Chocobo closest to Cloud and
"talk" to it, he'll say "Wark". If you answer back "Warrk!" (I think), the
Chocobos in the pen will do a little dance for you. After the dance, you'll
receive the Choco/Mog Summon Materia.

Anyways, you will also have a chance to get the Chocobo Lure Materia during
disc two. Once you have the Highwind available to you, you can return to the
Chocobo Ranch, and the Chocobo Lure will be right out in front of the pens, on
the ground. This will only be here once.

These are the only two ways to get the Chocobo Lure Materia (except mastering
one of these), so don't lose them or sell them off. If you lose both of them,
you will not be able to catch, raise or breed Chocobos. The only Chocobo you
will be able to get is the Gold you receive from the Kalm Traveler (see section
[g21]).

The chart below shows the chances of encountering a Chocobo on the different
tracks on the World Map with either one or two Chocobo Lures equipped at diff-
erent levels. (Thanks to Absolute Steve for the use for this chart.)

'-------------'-------'---------------'---------------'-----------------------'

You should also have some greens. Greens are Chocobo food. Without greens keep-
ing them occupied, it is very complicated to try to catch Chocobos. Buy some
greens from ChocoBilly or the Chocobo Sage (disc two or three only). You should
buy Curiel Greens (from ChocoBilly) or Reagan Greens (from the Chocobo Sage) to
catch Chocobos as they will hold the Chocobos longer than the others available
early on in the game.

After you've received your Chocobo Lure Materia and some greens, you need to
equip the materia on one character. It doesn't matter whom. It will also help
to manually re-arrange your items, so the greens are the first item. Once you
meet up with a Chocobo, they don't hang around long, and the greens are the
only thing that will keep them around. All you have to do is wander around the
area on the world map where you see the Chocobo tracks, and one will show up
soon enough. Chocobos always show up with groups of enemies.

Note: You do not have to be walking directly on the tracks. Being close is good
enough, but I'm not sure how far from the tracks you're allowed to be.

The breakdown of what greens do to Chocobos in battle:

ChocoBilly's Greens
-------------------
Gyshal Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo occupied for 2 turns.
Krakka Greens:  Reduces the Chocobo's chance to run to 33.3%.
Tantal Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo occupied for 3 turns.
Pahsana Greens: Reduces the Chocobo's chance to run to 20%.
Curiel Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo occupied for 5 turns.
Mimett Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo busy for 1 turn

The Chocobo Sage's Greens
-------------------------
Reagan Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo busy for 8 turns and reduces the Chocobo's
                chance to run to 12.5%.
Sylkis Greens:  Keeps a Chocobo occupied for 1 turn

So, as you can see, Curiel Greens are the best thing available from ChocoBilly
to keep Chocobos around, and, while Reagan Greens are the best overall, they
are not available early on. Just make sure you do not attack a Chocobo during
the battle or cast any magic or summons which will attack all, as this will
cause the Chocobo to freak out and run. Use the green quickly and kill off the
remaining enemies. The game will confirm that "You've caught a Chocobo." You're
now ready to run.

Here are just a couple of tips for making the process go just a little quicker:

Two Chocobo Lure Materia (preferably with 2 or more stars on each), which will
     increase the chances of getting into a ChocoBattle and limit the regular
     battles you'll face (see above chart).
The Enemy Lure Materia, which will decrease the time between battles.
A strong arsenal of weapons, which will make finishing battles quickly easier.
Your Reagan Greens (or whichever Greens you choose) located to the first spot
     in your inventory.
Pre-emptive Materia, which will help ensure you're not back-attacked

A few Chocobo-catching "Do Nots":

Do not use Slash-All or Mega-All Materia as they will attack the Chocobo you're
     trying to catch.
Do not use and green Materia paired with All as an offensive spell.
Do not use summons (though I've heard Odin works).
Do not pair Sneak Attack Materia to anything offensive, as it'll have a chance
     to attack the Chocobo.
Do not have multiple Counter Attack Materia on one party member, if the first
     counter kills the attacking enemy, the party member will randomly attack
     another enemy, which could be the Chocobo.
Do not pair Counter (Command) or Magic Counter with any Commands/Magic that
     target multiple enemies.

You're all set!

*******************************************************************************

Once you have purchased/rented a stable from ChocoBilly (available disc two
once you have control of your airship, the Highwind), you will be able to keep
any Chocobo you catch. Once the ChocoBattle is finished and you're riding high
on your newly acquired Chocobo, you can now choose to dismount the Chocobo. It
will not run away. You will have the option of sending it back to the stables
or setting it free. Any Chocobo you send to the stables will be waiting for you
outside of the barn in the pen.

Once you return to the Chocobo Ranch, talk to ChocoBilly. He will have a list
of options for you. One of the options will be "Moving Chocobos". Select this
and he will show you - one-by-one - each Chocobo you have caught and give you
the option of releasing it or sending it to the stables. I'll talk more about
what he says a little later on and what it means. ChocoBilly will also tell you
the gender of the Chocobo at this time and let you name the ones you keep.

Note: when you get ready to start breeding Chocobos, I suggest that you name
your Chocobos something gender-specific. If it's a Female Chocobo, give it a
Female name. It also makes some sense to put some form of hint about the rating
of the Chocobos that you keep for breeding purposes.

I name my Great Female Chocobos "GreatF"; Blue Male Chocobos are named "BlueM".
So on and so forth. This will keep things straight in your stables and make it
easy to keep track of who's racing and how many races you've raced with each
one. Just remember, you only have six spaces to name your Chocobo.

You will be able to choose any Chocobo you have moved into the stables to ride
around on at any time, unless you release it. Once you have started catching
and keeping your own Chocobos, you can dismount them, and they will stay. You
can also ride your Chocobos onto the Highwind (get close to it and hit the
"confirm" button) and take your Chocobos all over the world.

*******************************************************************************

There is one instance on disc one where you will be forced to race a Chocobo.
This is a story-related event, and you must win the race. It is not a hard
race, and there are things you can do to make it easier on yourself. Even if
you don't win the first time, Esther (your "manager") will give you another,
better Chocobo and send you back out to the races.

Racing Basics
-------------

If you want to breed Chocobos, understanding racing will make things a lot
easier on you. First off, you'll notice that there are several things going on
the screen during a race. The colors of the track are very bright. There's a
meter on the left that's filled with red when you start. This is your stamina
bar. It'll tell you how "tired" your Chocobo is. There's the box on the bottom
which tells you if you're racing in "Manual" or "Automatic" mode. There's a
thing on the right that tells you the order of the Chocobos in the race right
now, and there's a map of the course you're on. You'll notice on the map that
there's one part in white and the rest of it is grayed out. The grayed-out
portion of the track duirng your first race is the long track, and I'll talk
more about that later.

Controls
--------

Again, anytime you're working with Chocobos, it is best to revert your
controller back to its default settings. Once the race starts you will have
no control whatsoever of your chocobo, this is because all races start in
"Automatic control". Pressing the 'select' button will change it to "Manual"
control, which will make winning a whole lot easier. Now that you have "full"
control of your Chocobo, here are the controls:

Directional pad: use to control your Chocobo's movement to the left or right.
     Pressing up or down does nothing special. No, you cannot fly.
X: decreases your running speed. (note: slowing down enough will help to refill
     your stamina bar.)
Square: increases your running speed. (note: speeding up enough will slowly de-
     crease your stamina bar.)
O (circle): causes your Chocobo to sprint. (note: sprinting quickly drains your
     stamina bar and should not be done for long periods of time.)
Triangle: has no use in Chocobo racing.
Select: switches from "Manual" to "Automatic" control and back again.
Start: Pauses the game.
R1, R2, L1 & L2 by themselves have no use during Chocobo racing - more on that
     in the next paragraph.
Analog Sticks (either on the newer PlayStation controllers or the PS3 DualShock
     controller): has no use in Chocobo racing (or anywhere else in the game.
Analog "Nub" (PSP only): Acts as L2, R2 and L2+R2 by pressing left, right and
     up respectively, which by thelselves do nothing during the races.

Note: Esther will go over these controls with you before your first race, and
anytime you start racing on disc two (after gaining access to the Highwind),
you can ask her to "teach" you how to race.

Next, any time you are racing, I would press the 'select' button to change from
"Automatic" control to "Manual" control. Then, there is a little cheat that you
can use to make sure you maintain stamina. Holding down R1+R2 on your control-
ler while you race will slowly but steadily refill your stamina bar. This will
come in handy, especially if you're not a seasoned, veteran racer. Without this
little trick, it is sometimes very hard to keep enough stamina to finish the
race strong.

Generally speaking, the first race isn't too hard. I usually start with a lit-
tle sprint just to get ahead of the pack or at least a steady second. Then I
will lay off the sprint and just increase my running speed until the stamina
bar is barely going down. I usually hold this until I cross over a little hump
and there's a path that (to me) looks like red carpet. I will sprint from here
and try to take the lead if I've not done so by this point. Once I get a bit
of a lead, I stop sprinting. You'll soon come up to a space-type area. Sprint-
ing here doesn't do much good, as all basic Chocobos are slowed down at this
point. Watch the map on the screen, and if you see a Chocobo start to encroach
on your lead (or if you can see one on your screen), then sprint as fast as
you can until you reach the finish line. This strategy usually works well for
me, but it is not the only strategy around. The race is a lot easier using the
R1+R2 stamina trick, since you will be able to sprint more.

Once you have finished and won this race, you'll not be able to race Chocobos
again for quite some time.

Fast forward to disc two. I'll try not to spoil too much, but there is a short
time on disc two where your party will be split up. Once you have access to the
Highwind (the airship), you can start catching and breeding Chocobos, but the
Gold Saucer will be closed for business at this point. However, I recommended
that you wait until the entire party is back together. You can begin racing
Chocobos once your entire team is reunited as the Gold Saucer will be open
again. At this time, you can also pick up the second Chocobo Lure materia in
front of the pens at the Chocobo Ranch.

Classes:
--------

Once you begin racing Chocobos, you'll notice that your Chocobo will be en-
tered into the "C-Class" races. After you win three races, you'll be promoted
to the "B-Class" races, and after another three wins, you'll find yourself in
the "A-Class" races. Finally, after another three wins, the "S-Class" races are
open to you. Esther will let you know each time you move up to the next level.

Note: The mandatory race one disc one is a "B-Class" race, and Esther has four
different Chocobos that she will let you race with. Each one is a little better
than the one you raced with before. The stats for these Chocobos is in the
"stats" section ([e02]).

Also Note: Once your Chocobo has been promoted to the next level, you cannot go
back and race the lower level races with that Chocobo. Each Chocobo advances
individually.

Joe/TEIOH
---------

During the races, there is a chance you'll see a Chocobo named TEIOH. That's
Joe and his speedy Chocobo. Don't worry about his stats. His speed is always
10% higher, and his stamina is always 25% higher than yours. Luckily for you,
he's really not that good of a racer. He wears his Chocobo out pretty early. If
you're having trouble beating him, use the "stamina trick", and he'll lose to
you pretty regularly. TEIOH is also a Black Chocobo. As a Black Chocobo, he in-
curs no speed penalty in the "Space" area of the Short Track nor the "Water"
area of the Long Track.

For the purpose of racing, all other Chocobos are Yellow/regular, regardless of
what their on-screen color is. Those colors are only chosen for the different
Chocobos for identification purposes. The colors are determined by the Choco-
bo's racing position.

Joe never appears in "C-Class" races nor the mandatory race on disc one, but
there is a chance of him showing up in every class after that as follows:

--------------------------
! "B-class" ! 1/8 chance !
! "A-Class" ! 1/4 chance !
! "S-Class" ! 1/2 chance !
--------------------------

The Stats
---------

Just like the characters with which you fight battles, your Chocobos have stats
that grow. However, The stats don't grow by "leveling" your Chocobos; they grow
by feeding your Chocobos greens. Keep in mind that not all of these stats are
visible to the player. You can ask Chole at the Chocobo Ranch to "rate" your
Chocobos, and she'll be able to tell you which one is the fastest, quickest,
etc.

The Chocobo Stats (with a short description of each) are:

Dash - Chocobo's sprinting speed (holding O) - this is a visible stat... to an
     extent. This stat is shown as "Speed" on the Chocobo status screen before
     each race. The total "Dash" value is between 1 and 6,000; "Speed" is
     "Dash" divided by 34. (i.e. 6000/34 = 176, a Chocobos max. speed). For any
     results not equal to a whole number, any numbers following the decimal are
     dropped on screen. Example: Dash = 4267, 4267/34 = 125.5, 125 is shown.
     Maximum value = MDash

MDash - The highest "Dash" rating a Chocobo is capable of getting - invisible.
     Maximum value = 6000

Run - The Chocobo's average running speed (with no adjustments) - invisible.
     Maximum value = MRun

MRun - The highest possible "Run" rating - invisible.
     Maximum value = 6000

Stamina - The Chocobo's endurance/how fast the "Stamina Meter" drains while
     sprinting or running faster - visible... to an extent. The stat shown as
     "Stamina" on the Chocobo status screen before a race shows the Chocobo's
     total stamina divided by ten. Stamina is a value between 1 and 9,999. You
     will see a value no greater than 999 for one of your Chocobos.
     Maximum value = 9999

Acceleration - How quickly the Chocobo accelerates - invisible.
     Maximum value = 100

Co-operation - How well your Chocobo gets along with you as a rider. This stat
     determines how well the Chocobo will listen to you while under "Manual"
     control and is always set to zero by default when you catch or breed a
     new Chocobo. - invisible. 
     Maximum value = 100

Intelligence - How smart your Chocobo races on its own. This stat will deter-
     mine how well your Chocobo races in "Automatic" control. - invisible.
     Maximum value = 100

Races won - How many times a Chocobo has crossed the line in first place. This
     stat obviously is always set to zero when you catch or breed a Chocobo -
     invisible.

Gender - Ummm...if you need an explanation on this, please ask your parents -
     technically invisible, but ChocoBilly will tell you the gender when you
     move the Chocobo from the pen to the stables or when a new Chocobo is
     bred. Once you have been given the gender of the Chocobo, it is usually
     a good idea to give the Chocobo a name that will let you know what the
     gender is. For example: Billy says "This is a Great Chocobo! Please, name
     this female Chocobo.", a smart thing to do might be to name it GreatF or
     something similar to let you know the rating and the gender. Once you've
     named the Chocobo, there's no telling what the gender is. Gender has no
     bearing on racing ability.

Color - What color your Chocobo is - visible with a color TV.

Rating - The rating your Chocobo is. This was told to you when you asked to
     move your Chocobo from the pen to the stable. It rates from "Terrible" to
     "Wonderful". More on this later.

Esther’s Chocobos
-----------------

Esther has four different Chocobos she will let you race with during the manda-
tory race. If you lose a race, she’ll give you the next Chocobo in line. Here
are the stats of the four Chocobos in the order that you’ll race them upon
losing:

             First    Second     Third    Fourth
             -----    ------     -----    ------
Dash          3000      3200      3700      4500
Run           2200      2500      3000      3500
Accel           50        50        50        50
Co-Op           50        60        80       100
Intel           50        60        80       100
Stamina       3200      3400      4000      6000

All of a Chocobo's stats are determined when the Chocobo is moved from the pens
to the stables. When you move a Chocobo, its starting MDash and Stamina stats
always start at pre-determined values depending on what rating of Chocobo you
caught. The following table shows the possibilities of stats for each rating.

Note: Thanks to Terence for this information.

Adjusting MDash and Stamina
---------------------------

Now, once the base values for Max Dash and Stamina have been determined, they
will be adjusted separately:

1/2 chance of being increased by Rnd(0..127)
1/2 chance of being decreased by Rnd(0..127)

Adjusting Dash 
--------------

This is a lot simpler than the previous section, Dash is set to merely a per-
centage of the MDash Stat.  The formula used depends on the Rating:

Wonderful, Great, Good and So-So: 
  Dash = [Max Dash / 10] * Rnd(5..8)

Average, Poor, Bad and Terrible: 
  Dash = [Max Dash / 10] * ([Rnd(0..255) / 50] + 3)

Adjusting Run and Max Run
-------------------------

These are again related, so we will deal with them together.

First, we must define a modifier we will be using. It differs depending on
the Rating of the Chocobo:

Wonderful, Great, Good and So-So:
  x = 100 * Rnd(2..4)

Average, Poor, Bad and Terrible:
  x = 100 * Rnd(2..5)

Once this is defined, then:

Max Run = Max Dash - x 
Run =     Dash - x

Assigning Acceleration and Intelligence
---------------------------------------

Acceleration and Intelligence are randomly determined multiples of 10, again
based on the Rating:
                        Acceleration      Intelligence
Wonderful/    Great:   10 * Rnd(6..7)    10 * Rnd(5..6)  
     Good/    So-So:   10 * Rnd(5..6)    10 * Rnd(3..4)
  Average/     Poor:   10 * Rnd(3..5)    10 * Rnd(0..2)
      Bad/ Terrible:   10 * Rnd(2..5)    10 * Rnd(0..2)

There is one more stat that I will address in the next section, but for all
intents and purposes, you now have your Chocobo!

The "Kalm Traveler's" Chocobo
-----------------------------

You receive a Gold Chocobo for returning the "Desert Rose" to the "Kalm Trav-
eler". The Chocobo is always rated as a Great Chocobo and has a 50% chance of
being male and 50% chance of being female. See Sections [g20] and [g21] for
information on obtaining the "Desert Rose" and what to do with it.

Here are the other stats on this Chocobo:

Dash:   1000     MDash:  3000
Run:     500     MRun:   2500
Stam:   1000     Accel:    60
Co-Op:     0     Int:      30

There are two ways to improve the stats of your Chcoobos: breeding and feeding.
Feeding will be covered in section [e04], and breeding will be covered in the
breeding chapter a little later in the guide [f00].

The Order of Stats
------------------

When you move your Chocobos from the ChocoPens to the Stables, they are ass-
igned their stat values based on the position of the RNG Markers. The stat sel-
ection order is the same everytime.

Each time a stat is assigned, the RNG Marker advances one place down the line,
so moving Chocobos will advance the Chocobo-related RNG Marker twelve places
(thirteen places for Terrible Chocobos).

The order in which the stats are assigned is as follows:

1.  MDash/Stamina pair
2.  MDash adjustment size picked
3.  MDash adjustment added or subtracted
4.  Stamina adjustment size picked
5.  Stamina adjustment added or subtracted
6.  Dash set
7.  Run and MRun set* (see note below)
8.  Accel set
9.  Intel set
10. Personality attempted to be set at 0 (see next section)
11. Personality set at 1 or 2 (only if Personality =/= 0)
12. Gender set** (see note below)

* - For Terrible Chocobos - between 7 & 8, dummy roll with no meaning
** - The chances of receiving a Male of Female Chocobo are not exactly 50/50
     for all Ratings. Terrible Chocobos have a 134/256 (~52.3%) chance of being
     Male (122/256 chance of being Female), and Wonderful Chocobos have a
     122/256 (~47.7%) chance of being Male (134/256 chance of being Female).

*             [e03] A Final Note About Chocobo Stats (Personality)            *
*******************************************************************************

Note: I separated this section from the other stat section in this guide be-
cause there is still some confusion as to what Personality does for Chocobos
beside making them do different things on the racing menu. There also appears
to be some difference in the way the different racing types effect the breeding
RNG. From what I've read, I assume it's because Personality types 1 and 2 re-
quire an additional RNG roll. There's a lot that's not completely clear about
it. However, it's in the game, so for now, it's here.

Also Note: Special thanks to Terence for this information. This is pretty much
a copy/paste from his mechanics breakdown on the qhimm forum (with some minor
formatting revisions and replacing Run Type with "Personality").

From Terence:

Before you start reading and stuff, I'd like to ask for a little help: there's
a stat that I've decided to call Personality. Now, it has three possible val-
ues: 0, 1 or 2. I've noticed that Personality 2 chocobos look like they're for-
ever dashing on the setup screen when you play Chocobo Racing. However, Person-
ality 2 chocobos are "rarer" than the better Ratings (only a 1/16 chance to get
a Personality 2 Wonderful Chocobo). In addition, there's a Green that allows
you to "remove" Personality 1 and 2 and replace it with 0 after enough feeding
(and if you feed it enough to cause that, you'll get a fanfare and ChocoBilly
will say that "their personality's improved!"). [Note: This is the Pasana
Green] So, I'm assuming that Personality 1 and 2 are "BAD".

But, I don't know what they do. I've watched the effects of Intelligence and
Co-Operation first hand in Chocobo Racing... but Personality doesn't "seem" to
affect anything that noticable. Maybe Intelligence overwrites it on auto,
but... eh. I dunno.

BrutalAl also made the observation that a Personality 2 Chocobo will appear as
a "dashing" Chocobo on the pre-race screen. There appears to be no visible
difference between 0 and 1. They both appear to be "trotting" or "jogging".

If anyone wants to help Terence and myself solve this puzzle, be my guest.

And, on to Personality:

And finally, Personality is randomly determined. First, you have a chance at
Personality 0 - the Normal Personality - and this depends on the Rating again:

                              Chance of Personality 0
Wonderful/    Great:                    7/8
     Good/    So-So:                    3/4
  Average/     Poor:                    1/2
      Bad/ Terrible:                    1/2

If you don't get Personality 0, then you have a 50/50 chance each of Personal-
ity 1 and 2.

To be an effective racer, yes, you have to feed your Chocobos. What you feed
them makes a difference, too. The easiest way for me to describe it is, you get
what you pay for. As I have previously stated, Chocobos eat greens. The types
of greens they eat determine the amount their attributes increase. This list is
a little long, so please, bear with it.

Note: Greens fed to Chocobos in the field (battle) have no effect on a Choco-
bo’s stats. It also seems that greens fed to Chocobos while on the Highwind
have no effect on the Chocobo's stats. Only greens fed to Chocobos in the sta-
bles will effect their stats.

Also Note: unless otherwise specified, only whole numbers are used.

*******************************************************************************

Ok. Here's the background behind this section. My wife was at some all-night,
girl-only party, and I got a little bored. And, I figured, what better way to
pass some time than racing Chocobos and timing the races. I spent some time
actually timing the races. Just in case someone wanted to know how much time
the races take. Here's what I came up with.

Note: These times are not absolutes, they are the approximate averages of the
times that the computer-controlled Chocobos will cross the finish line in each
particular level.

C-Class:
 - Short Track - 1 minutes, 40 seconds
 - Long Track  - 2 minutes, 15 seconds

B-Class:
 - Short Track - 1 minute, 15 seconds
 - Long Track  - 1 minute, 40 seconds

A-Class:
 - Short Track - 1 minute
 - Long Track  - 1 minute, 15 seconds

S-Class:
 - Short Track - 40 seconds
 - Long Track  - 1 minute

From my observations, it seemed in every race that I ran, the first Chocobo
that wasn't TEIOH or my own finish within 1.5 seconds of these times. Of
course, TEIOH's times varied greatly, depending on my own Chocobo's stats.

I bred a standard Gold Chocobo using the "No-Race-Required" method of breeding
([b04]) that had 156 speed and 546 stamina) and fed her 15 Sylkis Greens to max
out her speed and increase stamina, Co-Op and Inteligence. I regularly finished
the Short Track in about 45 seconds by putting the Chocobo in Manual (pushing
'select') and setting the controller on a table. If I pressed the accel button
for about one-half second from the start, the Gold Chocobo would finish about
3-4 seconds ahead of the S-Class pack (at about 36.5 seconds, depending on
traffic) with no other adjustments during the race.

Joe's Chocobo (with 174 speed and 701 stamina) racing against this Gold fin-
ished at about 35 seconds +/- .5 seconds each time. If I pressed accel twice
for a half second each from the start and left it, I ran out of "gas" with just
enough time for Joe to take me by somewhere between .1 and .2 seconds. 

All of these tests were run without the "stamina trick".

Without the stamina trick, my best time was around 31 seconds. With it, I hit
27 seconds. It could have been a little better, but at that time I had only fed
my Gold 15 Sylkis Greens to improve stats. I did not try to breed a faster Cho-
cobo.

*                         [e06] Chocobo racing prizes                         *
*******************************************************************************

Once you start racing Chocobos, you'll notice that there is a board on the cho-
cobo selection screen that has numbers on it. This board looks something like
this:

+---+---+---+---+---+
!1-2!1-3!1-4!1-5!1-6!
+---+---+---+---+---+
!2-3!2-4!2-5!2-6!3-4!
+---+---+---+---+---+
!3-5!3-6!4-5!4-5!5-6!
+---+---+---+---+---+

There will also be a list of possible prizes listed on the bottom, which will
look something like this:

+---+
! I ! POTION
+---+

+---+
! II! TRANQUILIZER
+---+

+---+
!III! ETHER
+---+

This will tell you the prizes that you can win with the proper combination of
the first- and second-place Chocobos. There is a mini-game in which you can
participate, where you can make a pick of who you think will win the race and
place a "wager" on the race. You can win prizes this way, but that doesn't help
you breed Chocobos. So, I won't cover it at this time. As far as this portion
of the guide goes, I will only concern you with prizes for racing.

When you race, every time you win your race, you'll have the option of keeping
your prize or trading it for GP. As far as breeding goes, it doesn't matter if
you keep your prize or trade it. I would keep one of each materia you get and
keep any megalixirs you win. Trade the rest for GP and use it in the Battle
Arena or the Speed Square (also at the Gold Saucer) for more cool stuff.

In every individual race, three items are "randomly" selected. The common (low-
est GP given for trade) item has 7 out of the 15 squares (~46.6%), the uncommon
item (middle amount of GP for trade) 5 out of 15 squares (~33.3%), and the rare
item (highest amount of GP given for trade of the three items picked) only 3
out of 15 (20%). In all classes, items of 200 or more GP are always rare, and
there can only be one rare item per board. C-Class races have no rare items to
win. The rare item is always in the third space (from what I've seen).

The same item cannot appear on the same board more than once, so you will never
have two potions or two Enemy Away Materia on the same board.

I'm still working on obtaining the full mechanics behind it, but this is a lit-
tle look into the chances of the "rare" items appearing on the board for the
S-Class races.

Note: The mechanics here only apply to the S-Class races. I'll keep searching
for the other classes.

Also Note: Thanks to shadow666 for digging around and finding this information,
and again, thanks to Terence for figuring it all out.

By programming default, there is a 7/8 chance that a rare item will appear in
the third of three prize spots. The game will then choose three random items to
put into the three slots, using the 7/8 check on the third spot. If the check 
fails the "rare item" check, the game will put a "non-rare" item into this
spot. The "non-rare" item will always be one of the better items on the chart.
If the item placed into the "rare item" spot is already on the board, it'll re-
move that item from the board and re-run the "rare-item" check using the init-
ial 7/8 check. This will actually increase the chances of getting any rare item
to about 90.25%.

Now, in S-Class races, there are ten rare items. The system lists the elixirs
twice in the sequence of rare items, so there's a 1/11 chance of each rare
item being selected for that spot if it passes the initial (or secondary)
check (with elixirs having a 2/11 chance).

So, there is a 7/8 chance that there will be a rare item up for grabs and a
1/11 chance for each item to be picked. That means each rare item has a 7/88
chance to be on the board for any given S-Class race (7/44 chance for elix-
irs).

Now, on the prize board, there are fifteen places for prizes, and only three
of those places receive the rare item. There is no way of knowing beforehand
which three places have the rare item, so you're kind of out of luck. All you
can really do is race the race and hope for the best, and you should have a
1/5 chance of landing on the rare item.

Finally, if you're searching for a particualr rare item, you have to figure
in all of the chances to know what your chances of getting the item you need.
Meaning this: There's a 7/8 chance of having any rare item on the board. If
that check passes, there is a 1/11 chance the item that is selectied will be
the item for which you're looking. Last, you have a 1/5 chance (if you win the
race) of landing on one of the rare item places on the prize board, leaving
you with a 7/440 (~1.59%) chance (roughly) of getting the item that you want 
(double that for elixirs).

Once you figure in the "repeat item" check in the first step, your chances
improve to a whopping ~1.65%.

Note: From experience (I have no first-hand understanding of the mechanics on
this), I have figured the "rare item" check on "A-Class" races to be about 3/4
chance of a rare item with six rare items. If elixirs are listed twice here,
then there would be about a 3/140 (~2.14%) chance of winning any particular
rare item during "A-Class" races (double that for elixirs). Again, these fig-
ures could be wrong, as I don't know the exact chances of the rare items show-
ing up according the actual game mechanics.

Note: From experience (I have no first-hand understanding of the mechanics on
this), I have figured the "rare item" check on "B-Class" races to be about 1/2
chance of a rare item with two rare items. If elixirs are listed twice here,
then there would be about a 1/30 (~3.33%) chance of winning any particular
rare item during "B-Class" races (double that for elixirs). Again, these fig-
ures could be wrong, as I don't know the exact chances of the rare items show-
ing up according the actual game mechanics.

* - GP is only awarded if prize is rejected

If you win ten "S-Class" races in a row, Esther will make a comment that you
have broken Joe's record of wins (or something like that) and will give you
some additional items. They are: Sprint Shoes, Precious Watch, Cat's Bell,
Chocobracelet and a Counter Attack Materia. This is a one-time event.

Note: There are two errors with the in-game item listings.

1. There is no Magic Counter Materia in Chocobo Racing. The Counter Attack Mat-
eria is wrongly listed as Counter Materia instead. You won't win a Counter. You
will receive a Counter Attack instead.

2. You will never receive a Hi-Potion for a race. If the game says you've won a
Hi-Potion, your inventory will show an increase of one Tranquilizer, but you
can still trade the Hi-Potion for 15 GP (whereas the Tranquilizer is only good
for 10 GP).

*                          [e07] Betting on the races                         *
*******************************************************************************

At any time that you have access to the Gold Saucer, you may bet on the Chocobo
races. Once you have your own Chocobos, you can place bets on any Class of Cho-
cobo that you own or below (example: if you have one A-Class Chocobo and one C-
Class Chocobo, you can bet on A-Class, B-Class or C-Class but not S-Class).

To place a wager on a race, step up to the counter in the center of the screen
and talk to the lady behind it. She'll ask if you want to place a wager on the
next race for a 200 gil registration fee. If you accept, you'll be given the
choice of which Class you would like to wager on. The amount of money you spend
on each wager depends on which Class you choose, as follows:

S-Class - 500 gil per bet
A-Class - 300 gil per bet
B-Class - 200 gil per bet
C-Class - 100 gil per bet

Once you've selected the Class on which you'd like to wager, you'll be taken to
the "pre-race" screen as mentioned above ([e06]). You'll also have the oppor-
tunity to "scout" the Chocobos that are racing to help make your decision. Then
you'll be able to choose up to three combinations that you think will make up
the one-two finish. You do not need to get the order correct, only the two Cho-
cobos that you think will finish first and second.

As of yet, I have not figured out any rhyme or reason to figuring out what de-
termines which Chocobo will finish where. The only thing I've noticed is the
Chocobos that appear to be "sprinting" on the pre-race screen seem to have
troubles finishing in the top two. So, I generally don't pick them.

Most of the time, the stats are so close, that I don't think the few points
that they differ make a difference. This is especially true at the higher lev-
els.

It's kind of unfortunate that Joe/TEIOH do not show up during these races since
that would at least almost guarantee at least one of the Chocobos that would
finish in the top two. However, without your Chocobo being in the race, there
would be nothing to base his stats on.

As far as actually placing the wagers, I've come to the conclusion that the
best method for betting is to pick one Chocobo that you feel will do really
well and pick three combinations with that one. Stamina seems to play a bit
more into the winning decision than speed does (from my experience), but that's
not always true.

So, what I'll do is pick the Chocobo with maybe the second highest Stamina (as
long as their speed is among the top as well, and they're not a sprinting Cho-
cobo) and three Chocobos with the highest Stamina scores. It doesn't always
work, but I do win my bets occasionally. This method at least gives you the
shot of having one Chocobo that you think will finish in the top two (out of
six for a 1/3 shot) and three other Chocobos that you think will finish in the
top two (1/5 shot on each). I'm not exactly sure what the odds of winning using
this method are, but this does not appear to be completely horrible.

However you work it, you have (technically) a 1/5 shot at winning a prize even
picking three random entries.

You will not have any clue if the race will be the Long Track or the Short
Track ahead of time, and that seems to make a bit of difference during the
races. I have not, however, noticed any difference in the trends behind the
wagering.

I think the hidden stats (intel/Co-Op, Accel, etc) probably play a part in
which Chocobos win these races, but unfortunately, you cannot see these, so
there's no way to base any decisions on them.

After you've placed your bets, press start, and the race will begin. You have
no controll over the races. So, sit back, relax for a minute or two and see
what happens.

However, after all of this, the prizes for winning the wagers are the same as
winning the races (and you have better odds at rare items by racing), so plac-
ing bets (in my opinion) is kind of a waste of time.

*******************************************************************************
*                     [f01] What are the different types?                     *
*******************************************************************************

There are five different colors of Chocobos. They are Yellow, Blue, Green,
Black and Gold. Each Chocobo has its own abilities which make it unique.

A very important thing to remember is to save often when breeding Chocobos. You
should always save before attempting to breed or move Chocobos. If you get a
type of Chocobo that you don't want or need, you should reset the game, advance
the RNG and try again.

*                       [f02] Breeding Chocobos - why?                        *
*******************************************************************************

Without breeding, there is no way that you can produce the colored Chocobos
(except a Gold Chocobo, but more on that in just a moment.) They give you 
access to some of the most useful and powerful materia in the game. They also
make racing easier, as each of the colored Chocobos has an area of the course
where they are not supposed to incur a speed "penalty". Chocobos just make this
game overall easier.

There are really two ways to get a Gold Chocobo. First, you can defeat Ruby
WEAPON once he appears. There are plenty of conditions that have to happen
before he will even show up. He is a VERY difficult optional boss with 800,000
HP, and that's not an exaggeration. You will also most likely start the fight
with him as a solo character as he will instantly knock two random party mem-
bers completely out of the battle. If you beat Ruby WEAPON, he'll drop the
Desert Rose. You can take this item to the village of Kalm and give it to the
guy known as the "Kalm Traveler". For this item, he'll provide you with a Gold
Chocobo. This battle requires proper preparation to be successful. Please,
refer to the Ruby WEAPON ([g20]) section of this guide (or many other guides
on GameFAQs.com or other sites) for assistance with defeating Ruby WEAPON.

The other way to get a Gold Chocobo is to breed one. This way seems a little
long and tedious at times, but if you follow this guide, it'll cut a lot of
time from the breeding process.

It could go without saying that you can only breed males together with females.
This game does not allow same-gender mating.

*******************************************************************************
*                            [f03] What do I need?                            *
*******************************************************************************

You will need just a few things when trying to breed a Gold Chocobo.

1) At least one "Chocobo Lure" materia. You can get this as soon as you get to
     the Chocobo Ranch the first time. If you get this one, you can still get
     a second one outside of the Chocobo Pens at the ranch during discs two
     and three. I recommend having both as this will increase your chances of
     getting into a ChocoBattle. I would also recommend taking a little time
     (during a normal grinding session) to level up your "Chocobo Lure" materia
     a couple of levels. This however is not necessary. It will speed up the
     process slightly.

2) Purchasing a few stables for your Chocobos. You should get at least four at
     10,000 gil per stable. This includes two for your original "parents" and
     two for the first two Chocobos you'll breed. If you want to keep it cheap,
     you can then release the "parents" and use the newly emptied stables for
     the newborns. I usually buy as many stables as I can to make things a
     little easier. You can buy up to six stables. It's your choice.

Note: It is possible to breed a Gold Chocobo with as little as three stables,
     but it requires you releasing one of the parent Chocobos as soon as
     they've bred one of the first Special Chocobos. It's just a little eas-
     ier to use all of the stables.

3) Purchasing some greens to catch and feed your Chocobos to make racing
     easier. Like I have said earlier, buying a few Reagan Greens for catching
     will make the ChocoBattles easier. These greens keep Chocobos busy for
     eight rounds of battle. The longer they are busy, the better your chances
     of catching a Chocobo will be. Reagan Greens only be purchased from the
     Chocobo Sage for 3,000 gil a piece or from the Battle Square for 2000 BP.
     Buy at least three or four. Buying Sylkis Greens will make improving the
     stats of your Chocobos faster and easier. Sylkis Greens can only be pur-
     chased from the Chocobo Sage for 5,000 gil a piece. They are well worth
     it. Buy about 50 of these.

4) You will need some nuts to breed. For some unknown reason, Chocobos do not
     like to breed unless they're fed a nut. You will need two types of nuts
     for the quickest breeding (although others work as well). You'll want to
     get three Carob Nuts. You can steal these from Vlakrados on the Northern
     Continent. They have 33,333 HP. You can steal the Nuts from them, or they
     can drop them after battle. You'll also need one Zeio Nut. You can steal
     them from Goblins on Goblin Island (due north of the Chocobo Ranch) in the
     forested area. Goblins also drop Zeio Nuts.

Note: If you steal any item from an enemy, they will not drop anything, so you
     cannot gain two nuts from any one battle.

5) You will need to catch some Chocobos to breed more. Other guides say you
     need a good female, a good male, a great female and a great male. Some say
     you need a good female and a great male or a good male and a great female.
     This is where these guides are not accurate.

When it comes to breeding, mating Good Chocobos with Good Chocobos and mating
     Great Chocobos with Great Chocobos have the same chance of breeding "Spe-
     cial" Chocobos as mixing Goods and Greats. The easiest way to get a Choco-
     bo with the best stats is to breed two Greats. When the stats for a new-
     born are determined, the game (with some exceptions) uses the average of
     the parents stats, so two Greats will produce a slightly better offspring
     than a Good and a Great. You can catch Great Chocobos in the area around
     Mideel and north of RocketTown, and you can catch Good Chocobos in the
     area around the Gold Saucer. You will also need one Wonderful Chocobo. You
     don't have to catch this one right away, as it will be one of the final
     breedings you have to do. Wonderful Chocobos are found around the Icicle
     Inn area on the Northern Continent.

6) A little time, a little patience. Breeding a Gold Chocobo, even using the
     fastest method to guarantee a Gold Chocobo available (without manipulating
     the RNG), it'll probably take a an hour or two. Make sure you save fre-
     quently, especially every time before you attempt breeding.

So, you have your materia. You have your stables. You have your greens and
nuts. You have some Chocobos and you're ready to take a little time to breed.
Let's get started.

*******************************************************************************

This is all of the statistical information about the nuts and how they affect
the Chocobos you’re breeding

Note: Special Thanks to Terence for the following information.

Also Note: Nuts are only available for purchase during discs two and three.

A few notes before we begin. The first Chocobo you pick is very important when
determining the stats of a baby for most of the Nuts. You'll also notice the
following:

1) It is impossible to make your first Green or Blue Chocobo without a Carob
Nut.

2) However, it *IS* possible to make a Black Chocobo with any Nut except a Zeio

3) While it's possible to get a guaranteed Gold Chocobo when mating a Black and
a Wonderful Chocobo (providing they have won enough total races), breeding a
Gold by mating a Black and a Gold is *NOT* a guarantee unless the Gold has a
Wonderful Rating.

So, some fairly interesting things to see.

If the baby Chocobo's Max Dash is under 4000, there is a 1/512 chance that a
bonus will be applied to the Chocobo's Dash stats, using the following:
1/128: Max Dash is set to 4000
1/128: Max Dash is set to 4100
2/128: Max Dash is set to 4200
3/128: Max Dash is set to 4300
1/128: Max Dash is set to 4500
120/128: No change to Max Dash

Its Dash is then set to its Max Dash, and then 6 random numbers each between 0
and 255 (Rnd(0..255)) are subtracted from it. That means that it could end up
anywhere between 0 to 1530 beneath your Max Dash.

Under those circumstances, there's a 50/50 chance it'll get either the father's
or the mother's Rating

*******************************************************************************

There are a number of techniques that you can use to breed Special or Colored
Chocobos, and I will discuss those in the next few sections. Most of these re-
quire certain nuts to be used and using Chocobos with certain ratings. Also in-
cluded in the mix of things that will produce Special Chocobos is the number of
races you've won with the Chocobos at the Chocobo Square at the Gold Saucer.

However, if you're breeding a Yellow Chocobo with another Yellow Chocobo and
none of the other checks pass, you will breed a Yellow Chocobo. Yellow Chocobos
that you breed (that do not meet the Special Chocobo criteria) will have a 50%
chance of having their father's rating and a 50% chance of having their
mother's rating. Gender is also determined at time of birth, and there's a 50%
chance of each gender. For stat distribution to newborn Chocobos that are not
"Special" or Colored, please refer to the Nuts section ([f04]).

*                       [f11] Types of Yellow Chocobos                        *
*******************************************************************************

Yellow Chocobos are your basic Chocobos. They are the only ones you will be
able to catch on the World Map. To learn how to catch Yellow Chocobos, please
refer to section [d32]. When you catch a Yellow Chocobo and send it back to the
pen, you'll have the option of moving it to the stables (if you've bought or
rented some) or releasing it from there. If you decide to move some Chocobos
from the pen to the stables, ChocoBilly will first tell you what he thinks of
your Chocobo. I will discuss this a little more in just a moment.

Note: If you missed the Choco/Mog Summon Materia on disc one, you can get it
now by talking to one of your own Chocobos before moving them to the stables.

All Yellow Chocobos have the ability to run over grass, swamp, beaches, dry
ground and forests. Pretty much anything that's not water or a mountain. While
riding a Yellow Chocobo, you will not encounter any random enemies. The only
times you can get into a fight while riding a Chocobo is if you stand still in
the marshes to the southeast of the Chocobo Ranch or run into Ruby WEAPON in
the desert outside of the Gold Saucer. The Midgar Zolom and Ruby WEAPON WILL
ATTACK YOU! If you don't want to fight the Midgar Zolom, keep moving. You will
outrun him. I realize this is less of a problem later in the game as he's not
that difficult of an enemy, but early on, defeating him takes some prepara-
tion. If you don't want to fight Ruby WEAPON, don't bump into him. He is a
pretty stationary object. You can also fight Diamond WEAPON by bumping into him
while riding any Chocobo.

If you decide to keep your Chocobo, ChocoBilly will tell you to name you Cho-
cobo and what gender it is. Gender is also selected at the time you move your
Chocobo from the pen to the Stable. He will say something along the lines of
"Name your [male/female] Chocobo!". There is a 50% chance of getting a male and
a 50% chance of getting a female.

There are actually eight different types of Yellow Chocobos, ranging from
Terrible through Wonderful. What type you get depends on where you caught it
and the enemies that were with the Chocobo when you caught it. When in doubt a-
bout which enemy you’re facing with a Chocobo, use sense, and that will tell
you the name. You can also push the select button on your controller, which
does not use a turn.

-------------------
Wonderful Chocobos:
-------------------

These are the best "natural" racing Chocobos. Their stats start higher than
their counterparts and they have higher max stats. You will need one of these
to breed a Gold Chocobo. Wonderful Chocobos can be found around the Icicle Inn
area on the Northern Continent. They will always be found with one or two
"Jumpings" (they look like rabbits). Toss a green, beat up the rabbits and send
your Wonderful Chocobo back to the Chocobo Ranch. When you go to move a Wonder-
ful Chocobo, ChocoBilly will say "This...is a Wonderful Chocobo!"

---------------
Great Chocobos:
---------------

These Chocobos are pretty good racers. You should have at least one of these
Chocobos when trying to breed a Gold Chocobo. More of that in a minute. Great
Chocobos can be found in the area around Mideel, which is on the island to the
southwest of the "Main" continent. They will always be with one or two "Spi-
rals". They look like purple armadillos. They can also be found in the area
north of RocketTown with two "Valrons" or two "Kyuvilduns". When you move a
Great Chocobo to the stables, ChocoBilly will say "This is a great Chocobo."

--------------
Good Chocobos:
--------------

These are about the lowest class Chocobos that you should race if you're int-
erested in racing. You can use these Chocobos when trying for a Gold Chocobo.
To understand this particular statement a little better, let me explain.

It was originally understood that you needed to have one Good and one Great
Chocobo when trying for a Gold Chocobo. It has since been discovered that this
is not true. When it comes to breeding, Good Chocobos and Great Chocobos are
considered the same. You can mate two greats, two goods or a good and a great,
and you'll have the same chance of breeding the proper Special Chocobos.

Anyways, Good Chocobos can be found around the area of the Gold Saucer with two
"Spencers". When you move the Good Chocobo to the stables, ChocoBilly will say,
"mmmm...this seems like a good Chocobo."

Note: if all that you're interested in is breeding, never keep any other Choco-
bo below this point on the list. While it is technically possible to breed a
Special Chocobo with one Good or Great Chocobo with any other rating of Choco-
bo, the chances of breeding one are significantly lowered, so if you're not
looking into racing just for fun, feel free to ignore the remaining Chocobo.

-----------------------
So-So or Fair Chocobos:
-----------------------

If you're a little crazy, you can race these birds, but it is completely unnec-
essary. You'll find So-So/Fair Chocobos around Junon with two or three "Cappar-
wires". You can also find them around Wutai with two "Tail Vaults" or three
"Razor Weeds". And lastly at Mideel with two or three "Headhunters". If you de-
cide to keep a So-So/Fair Chocobo, ChocoBilly will say, "mmm...this one's not
bad."

Notes: the two "Tail Vault" battle will be a "side view" battle. The two-
"Capparwire" battle will be a "side-view" battle.

-----------------
Average Chocobos:
-----------------

This is the lowest class of Chocobos that I have tried seriously racing. You'll
find Average Chocobos around the Gold Saucer with one "Harpy" or two "Flap-
beats". They are also around Wutai with two or three "Tail Vaults". ChocoBilly
will tell you, "this is a pretty average Chocobo.”

Note: the two-"Tail Vault" battle will be a "front-view" battle.

--------------
Poor Chocobos:
--------------

Poor Chocobos are just about useless as racers. You can find Poor Chocobos
around the Chocobo Ranch area with two "Mandragoras" or one "Mandragora" and
one "Levikron". They also hang out around Junon with two "Capparwires" or two
"Nerosuferoths". ChocoBilly's comment for these will be, "This one doesn't seem
very good."

Note: The two-"Capparwire" battle will be a "side-view" battle.

-------------------------
Weak or Terrible Chocobo:
-------------------------

If you get a Weak/Terrible Chocobo, you might as well throw it away. It will be
hard to get out of the C-Class races with this one. They are found in the Cho-
cobo Ranch area with two "Levikrons" or two "Elfadunks". They are also in the
Icicle Inn area with two "Bandersnatches" or one "Bandersnatch" and one "Jump-
ing". If, for whatever reason, you keep a Terrible/Weak Chocobo, ChocoBilly
will tell you, "I really can't recommend this one."

When racing Yellow Chocobos, they will be slowed by the "Space" area of the
short course and the "Water" area of the long course. All other Chocobo that
you race against are Yellow Chocobos, regardless of their actual physical
color, with the exception of TEIOH, who is a Black Chocobo and not slowed by
any of either tracks' "special" area because he is a Black Chocobo. More on him
later.

*******************************************************************************
*                     [f20] Breeding Blue/Green Chocobos                      *
*******************************************************************************

The process for breeding a Blue Chocobo is the exact same as it is for breeding
A Green Chocobo. A common misconception is you have to feed your Chocobos 99
Sylkis Greens and race them to S-Class racers before breeding. Another miscon-
ception is certain mixtures of Goods/Greats and Males/Females will result in
certain Colors and Genders of Chocobos. While these will (in theory) work, it
is not necessary and is a tremendous waste of time and gil.

The following is the most effective way to breed a Blue and Green Chocobos
without manipulating the RNG. Catch two Great Chocobos from the Mideel area.
I say Mideel because the experience is a little better there than the Rocket-
Town area. The Great Chocobos in this area will be found with one or two "Spi-
rals". They look like purple armadillos. 

Send these back to the ranch and move them from the pen to the stables. You
will have the opportunity to name your Chocobos, and I would suggest naming one
a masculine name and one a feminine name. This will make it a little easier if
you need to release one to know what gender you need to fill. Remember, gender
is determined at the time you move the Chocobo from the pen to the stables, and
it is a 50% chance of getting either gender. After you move the first one,
leave the ranch, save the game and move the second one. If you get the same
gender for both, reload the game, advance the RNG (see section [b01]) and try
again. Once you have a Male Great Chocobo and Female Great Chocobo, you're
ready to race.

Racing is not a requirement for breeding, but it will increase your chances.
You can also save yourself a little money (gil) here. As I said before, you do
not need to race both Chocobos to S-Class Chocobos to breed. To gain a Blue or
Green Chocobo, your Greats need a combined four wins. That's all. You can do it
several different ways to do this, but I recommend you feed one Great five to
ten Sylkis Greens and use this one to race.

Note: Even using the absolute worst-case scenario, feeding your Chocobo eight
Sylkis Greens will max out any Chocobo's Speed (Dash) stat. Any greens that you
feed a Chocobo beyond that will improve the Chocobo's Stamina, Inteligence and
Co-Op.

Winning four races is kind of child's play. After you have won four races with
this Chocobo, go back to the stables and tell ChocoBilly that you want to mate
Chocobos. Select your two Greats and use one of your Carob Nuts. If you breed
two Greats with a combined four wins and use a Carob Nut, there is a 100%
chance of breeding a Blue or a Green Chocobo. This is a 25% chance of getting
a Blue Male, a Blue Female, a Green Male or a Green Female. Save.

After two Chocobos have been bred and become "Parent" Chocobos, they need a
little time between breeding. Chocobo time is determined by random battles.
"Parent" Chocobos require between three and ten random battles before they're
ready to breed again. This number is "randomly" selected by the game and varies
from breeding to breeding and Chocobo to Chocobo. Go fight about ten battles or
so, SAVE and try breeding again.

Whatever you got from breeding from the first mating, you need to get the oppo-
site from this one. Example: if you received a Blue Male Chocobo from the first
mating, you'll need a Green Female Chocobo from the second. If you don't get an
opposite Chocobo, reload and try again (did I mention to save beforehand?). Re-
member to advance the RNG ([b01]).

Note: It is possible to breed Blue and Green Chocobos without racing. If you
breed a Good or Great with a second Good or Great, using a Carob Nut, you have
an approximately 23% (46/256) chance of a Blue Chocobo, 22% (44/256) chance of
a Green Chocobo and a 64.8% (166/256) chance of a regular Chocobo.

Also Note: It is also possible to breed Blue and Green Chocobos with only one
Good or Great Chocobo. As long as you select a Good or Great Chocobo first, you
can select any other type of Chocobo, but the chances of the above mechanics
working are reduced to 25%.

In other words, if you win four combined races with one Great Chocobo and one
Wonderful Chocobo, your chances of receiving a Blue Male are reduced to ~6.3%.
The same holds true for the other types (Blue Female, Green Male and Green
Female).

Final Note: That means it's possible to breed a Blue and a Green with a Good or
Great and any other Chocobo without racing. That chances are just pretty poor.
(~2.8% chance of each color/gender).

Anyway, once you've bred a Blue and a Green Chocobo and you have a male and a
female, you're ready to start working on the next step ([f30]).

*******************************************************************************

Blue Chocobos have all of the same abilities as Yellow Chocobos. They can also
run over shallow waters (rivers, streams and shallow oceans). They are also
known as "River" Chocobos.

There is one extra materia that is obtainable with the Blue Chocobos. It is the
"Quadra-Magic" materia. This materia is to the west of Wutai Island and north-
east of Mideel, along the island chain. To reach this materia, you need to take
your Blue Chocobo to the Island of Mideel. Then, follow the string of islands
to the west of Mideel around, and you'll eventually come across an island with
a cave on the northern tip. Take your Chocobo onto the island via the beach,
dismount and enter the cave. "Quadra-Magic" Materia allows the use of any
linked Magic (green) or Summon (red) Materia to be used four times in one turn.
It does use the MP required to cast the spell four times, and Knights of the
Round does not work with it.

When you race your Blue Chocobo, it will not be slowed by the "Water" area of
the long course. Although it takes a little longer, you may want to race your
Blue Chocobos on the long course, especially if you're trying to gain the
"S-Class" status. Since TEIOH is not slowed by the water, this make things a
little easier.

Note: the mechanic programmed to cancel out the "Water-area penalty" is known
to have a glitch where it does not always work as it's supposed to. This will
often cause the Blue Chocobos to be slowed by the "Water" area of the Long
Track. As of now, there's no way to over-ride this glitch.

*******************************************************************************

*******************************************************************************

Green Chocobos have all of the same abilities as Yellow Chocobos as well, but
instead of water, their forte is the mountains. They can climb any mountain in
the game. They are known as "Mountain" Chocobos. (Note: though Green Chocobos
can climb mountains, they cannot traverse cliffs.)

There is one materia that you can get once you've bred a Green Chocobo. With
the Green Chocobo, you can get the “Mime” material. If you keep going east from
the "Quadra-Magic" cave with the Highwind you'll come across Wutai Island
(conversely, you can also go west). On the east side of the island at around
the middle of the island close to the bridges, there is another cave. Use your
Green Chocobo to climb the mountains to get to the cave, which contains the
"Mime" Materia. This materia is AWESOME!

"Mime" Materia allows the use of whatever action was taken by the last member
of your team. Any action may be mimed with the exception of Limit Breaks. Limit
Breaks may only be mimed by the party member who originally used it (i.e. Tifa
cannot Mime Cloud's Limits, but she can Mime her own as long as no other ac-
tions have been taken). Mime also does not use any MP, so feel free to Mime any
magic or summon indefinitely.

When you race your Green Chocobo, it will not be slowed by the "Space" area at
the end of the short course. This is definitely very helpful. Again, TEIOH
takes no disadvantage into the "Space" area of the short course, so this will
level the playing field a little for this course.

*******************************************************************************
*                        [f30] Breeding Black Chocobos                        *
*******************************************************************************

Breeding a Black Chocobo is similar to breeding a Blue or a Green. You will be
mating your Blue and your Green that you've just produced. I know. It seems a
little sick as they are "related", but this is the fastest way.

If it's a moral dilema for you, feel free to catch two sets of parent Chocobos.
That way the Blue and Green won't be related to one another.

Newborn Chocobos are not ready to breed right away. They need a little time. As
we know, time in Chocobo breeding terms means fighting. Newborn Chocobos need
between three and eighteen random encounters to be ready to breed.

You should also race your Blue and or Green Chocobos to increase your chances.
Again, you don't need S-class Chocobos. To guarentee a Black Chocobo, your Blue
and Green Chocobos need a combined nine wins. To get these wins, start by feed-
ing the Chocobos some Sylkis Greens. Probably about five to ten would be pretty
good for starters.

I recommend racing your Green Chocobo to A-Class (this takes six wins). The
reason I recommend this is because the Green Chocobo incurs no speed penalty
from running through the "Space" area on the short course, and racing the short
course will save you time in the long run. You could keep going and get S-Class
with the Green Chocobo (nine wins), but the races are a little harder, and
you'll start racing against Joe and his Chocobo TEIOH more regularly. It's your
choice.

You could also feed your Blue Chocobo a few greens (mostly to increase co-oper-
ation as speed and stamina should not be an issue on C-Class races) and win
three races (long or short track - remembering that Blue Chocobos shouldn't in-
cur a speed penalty in the "water" area of the long track) and mate with a
Green with six wins.

However you do it, once you have nine combined wins between your Blue and Green
Chocobos and you've fought some random battles, so they're ready to mate, breed
your Blue and Green Chocobos using a Carob Nut. Assuming you've won nine com-
bined races and you're breeding using a Carob Nut, the chances of getting a
Black Chocobo are 100%. Again, gender is randomly selected and is a 50% chance
of either.

Note: It is possible to breed a Black Chocobo without racing. If you breed the
Blue and Green Chocobos with a Carob Nut, you have a 10/256 chance of getting a
Black, 128/256 of getting a Blue, 118/256 of getting a Green.

Also Note: It is also possible to breed a Black Chocobo using any Nut other
than a Zeio Nut. If you use any of the other nuts, you also do not have to race
to improve your chances as they are set chances for each nut as they are set
chances for each Nut. See The Nuts ([f04]) for complete details.

Once you have your Black Chocobo, you're ready to finish things off and get
your Gold Chocobo ([f40]).

*******************************************************************************

The Black Chocobo has all of the abilities of the Yellow Chocobos AND the Blue
AND the Green Chocobos. This means the Black Chocobo can cross all forms of
land, can cross rivers and streams and can climb mountains. This leaves the
deep oceans as the only thing that Black Chocobos cannot pass.

Once you have a Black Chocobo, you can reach the cave to the North of North
Corel. This cave holds the HP <=> MP materia. This materia will swap your Hit
Points with your Magic Points. I don't know why anybody would want this, but
it's there. You should get it for completion's sake if nothing else.

Also note that you can pick up the "Quadra-Magic" and "Mime" Materias with a 
Black Chocobo.

The Black Chocobo suffers no disadvantage in any area of any track. I stick
with The short course, just based on time, but you won't be slowed by either
track's "special" area. TEIOH is a Black Chocobo as well, and as such suffers
no disadvantage on either track.

*******************************************************************************

Take your new Black Chocobo and feed it about ten to fifteen Sylkis Greens. You
will also need to have a Wonderful Chocobo from the Icicle Inn area. You will
need to have twelve combined wins between your Black and Wonderful Chocobos to
guarantee a Gold Chocobo.

I recommend winning nine races with your Black Chocobo, since it incurs no
speed penalty in either the "Water" or the "Space" areas. Winning nine races
will give you an S-Class racer. You can race and win twelve if you like with
the Black Chocobo, as the S-Class races aren't really that hard with a Chocobo
that doesn't incur a speed penalty in "special" areas, but you can also feed
your Wonderful Chocobo a few greens and win three races with that one if you
want to stop the Black Chocobo at nine wins.

Note: Due to a glitch in this game's mechanics, you MUST select the Black Cho-
cobo first in the mating selection process. If you do, it is a 100% chance of
getting a Gold. If you don't, it is a 0% chance of getting a Gold.

Take your Black Chocobo (after fighting three to eighteen battles so it's
ready) and your Wonderful Chocobo and mate them using a Zeio Nut. If your Black
and Wonderful Chocobos have a combined twelve wins and you mate them using a
Zeio Nut, you have a 100% certainty of getting a Gold Chocobo.

Note: It is possible to get a Gold Chocobo without racing. If you breed the
Black Chocobo with a Wonderful Chocobo using a Zeio Nut you only have a 1/32
chance of getting a Gold Chocobo.

*******************************************************************************

Ahhh...the cream of the crop of Chocobos...The Gold Chocobo! With these Choco-
bos, you can go just about anywhere in the world. If you want to go run in the
ocean, go for it. Stand on a Mountain? Go ahead.

Now, it goes without saying that you cannot dismount your Chocobo while stand-
ing on a mountain or in the ocean, but the idea that you can do it all with one
Chocobo is a great thing. The Gold Chocobo can simply go almost anywhere in the
world with two exceptions. The only exceptions are the Northern Crater and any-
thing under water. You need to be on the Highwind to access the Northern Crater
and a submarine to access anything underwater. Sorry.

There is a cave on the northeast corner of the map. The entire island is sur-
rounded by mountains and is filled with forests. The only way on or off this
island is a Gold Chocobo. There is a cave on this island, which contains the
most powerful, individual, non-limit break attack known as "Knights of the
Round".

It's worth the trouble of breeding just to cast this spell once.

Gold Chocobos can also obviously grab any of the aforementioned Materia from
their respective caves.

Gold Chocobos also suffer no disadvantage in the races. They also receive a
bonus to their stats based on the breeding process to get one.

*******************************************************************************
*                            [f50] A Perfect Chocobo                          *
*******************************************************************************

There are a lot of questions on the message board about breeding "Perfect
Chocobos", so I’ve decided to add a section covering "Perfect Chocobos" for
your reading enjoyment.

Note: Thanks to phiefer3 for breaking this down into an understandable format.

Most of the stats: Stamina, Co-op, Intelligence, and Acceleration can be maxed
by all Chocobos and don't really require any special preparation. All of these
can be maxed after you get the others. (This means you can max these out by
feeding your Chocobo greens and not by mating.)

The only ones to really worry about are Run and Dash. These do require breed-
ing, because you need to get the correct caps to really max them out. As it is,
the Zeio Nut is easily the nut of choice, because it includes chances for both
the MRun and MDash stats of the baby to be higher than the parents'. Your best
bet is to start off by getting a Gold. Actually, you’ll want to get two Golds,
a male and a female, that way every time you breed them (or their offspring)
you'll always get a Gold as well, assuming you don't use a Carob Nut.

Since Dash is easier to check than Run, Run cannot exceed Dash (normally), and
the Zeio Nut has a chance to lower the MRun of the baby (but not MDash), you
should try to max the Dash stat first. So, what you want to do is feed the Gold
parents enough Sylkis Greens to max their Dash and Run stats (you can also feed
them enough to max their stamina, then all babies will be born with max stamina
as well). Then breed them and feed the baby one or two Sylkis Greens to cap
their Dash (and Run) stats (Dash and Run always start out at least a little be-
low the max), and then either go to the races to check the speed or talk to
Chole to see who she says is the fastest sprinter.

If the newborn is the fastest sprinter, then you want to replace the parent of
the same gender with the newborn (if the newborn is a female and is the fastest
sprinter release the mother and use the newborn instead). If one of the parents
is the fastest sprinter, either kick the newborn out or reset and try breeding
again (remember to soft reset to keep from having to "manipulate" the RNG).
You may also want to check at the races what the speed of the fastest sprinter
is (speed stat at races reflects dash stat, not run). Keep progressively breed-
ing until your sprinter has 176 speed. This will probably take two or three
times of getting a faster newborn. Actually, you want to get 2 Chocobos with
176 speed, a male and a female. Once you do then when you breed them (with a
Zeio nut) the baby is guaranteed to have 176 for its max speed (MDash).

You can now start working on Run. You basically want to do the same thing as
for Dash, except that you want to see who Chole says is the fastest runner. You
also won't really be able to tell as easily at the races just how high your Run
stat is. The only way will be to race it and during the race compare how fast
it goes when you just run (using square) and how fast it sprints (using circle)
the more similar the speeds the closer Run is to Dash which means the closer it
is to being maxed. You won't really be able to tell when you're as high as
possible, so just stop when you seem to be pretty close (this will also mean
that sprinting will be almost pointless when racing since you'll run at near
the same speed all the time).

Once Dash and Run are maxed (or close enough for your taste) you can worry
about the others. A total of 25 Sylkis greens will max out Co-op, between 25
and 100 Sylkis greens will max out Intelligence (though the greens you fed the
parents will also influence it, and Int is only important if you race on auto
instead of manual). Feed it as many more Sylkis greens are needed to max Stam-
ina out (if you haven't already).

Acceleration is the biggest pain to max. This is mainly because there's no way
to check it, and no greens guarantee an increase. Each Mimett has a 25% chance
to raise Accel by 1 point. If you started your breeding chain with 2 Greats
then your "Perfect" Chocobo will have between 60 and 70 Accel, if you started
with a Good then it'll be between 50 and 70. Accel caps at 80, so feed about 90
to 120 Mimett Greens and maybe some more for extra insurance.

that relate to Chocobos. Some of the information is covered elsewhere in this
guide, but this just serves as kind of a quick reference point for these
things.

*******************************************************************************
*                        [g02] ChocoBuckle Enemy Skill                        *
*******************************************************************************

There is one Enemy Skill that is Chocobo-specific. It is the ChocoBuckle Enemy
Skill. You learn it from Chocobos. 

The earliest you can learn it is right after you visit the Chocobo Ranch for
the first time. You must get the Chocobo Lure Materia from ChocoBilly and
equip it. You also need an Enemy Skill Materia, which the first one is avail-
able at the Sector 5 playground before the first assualt of ShinRa Headquar-
ters.

However, learning it is not as simple as standing there and waiting for a
Chocobo to use it on you. It requires a little extra work.

The first thing you need to do is learn the Enemy Skill L4 Suicide, which can 
be learned from Mu's, which are small mole-like creatures. They can be pretty
uncommon, and be careful that not all your character's levels can be divisible
by four, or you might get yourself killed. L4 Suicide causes critical damage
and Mini to everyone with a level divisible by four.

Note: It might be a while before they use the attack.

Once you've learned L4 Suicide, you're ready for ChocoBuckle.

It's a little tricky and requires quick action, but it's definitely possible.
It helps to have the Sense Materia and the Enemy Skill with L4 Suicide on dif-
ferent party members.

First buy at least one Mimett Green, and I would suggest saving. Equip the
Chocobo Lure Materia and get into a battle with a ChocoBattle. Use Sense to
check its level. For this area, it must be Level 16. If it's not, either re-
lease it and try again or re-load and try again. Once you've found a Level 16
Chocobo, use the Mimett Green and quickly cast L4 Suicide once its eating. The
Chocobo will counter with ChocoBuckle. Skill learned.

*                       [g03] The Chocobo Ranch Family                        *
*******************************************************************************

During your first trip to the Chocobo Ranch (or any time during disc one), you
will be able to meet the Chocobo Ranch Family. They are ChocoBill and his
grandchildren: ChocoBilly and Chole. ChocoBill stays in the house and Choco-
Billy and Chole stay in the stables and take care of things in there.

When you first enter the ranch, you'll be on a screen that has four Chocobos in
a pen, a building to the left and a barn to the right. If you speak to the Cho-
cobo closest to the front of the screen and select "Warrrrk..." as you option,
you'll see the Chocobos do a little dance for you and present you with the
Choco/Mog Summon Materia, which is the first summon available in this game.

---------
ChocoBill
---------

On disc one, ChocoBill will offer to let you stay at the ranch and rest up.
This acts as an inn, which will completley heal your characters. The cost for
this is 100 gil.

Once you have access to the Highwind, ChocoBill provides some additional infor-
mation about Chocobos and mentions the Chocobo Sage. He also is the one to whom
you'll have to talk in order to rent/purchase the stalls in the ChocoStable.

ChocoBill will have the following conversation with you after you have access
to the Highwind:

ChocoBill: "Oh what is that? What has this world come to? Stars falling and
     everything.
"With things the way they are now, how 'bout raising a Chocobo?
"No, I'm not trying to pesuade you for money. It's just because of the state of
     things in the world.
"I thought that it would be a good and healthy thing for you to raise some
     Chocobos...
"Hmmm... You just happen to be in luck!
"It just so happens that we aren't taking care of any Chocobos for anyone else,
     so...
"I could take care of 6 Chocobos right now for 10000 gil per Chocobo. How 'bout
     it?"

He will then give you three options:

 - Take care of my Chocobos
 - Tell me something else
 - How do you raise them?

Take care of my Chocobos
------------------------

ChocoBill: "To raise a Chocobo, you'll need a 'Chocobo Stable',
"And they rent for 10000 gil. Currently I can rent out up to 6 'Chocobo
     Stables'.
"If you rent a 'Chocobo Stable', we will keep up to 4 of the Chocobos you catch
     in the fenced area outside.
"At a later date, you can select the Chocobo that you would like to put in your
     'Chocobo Stable'.
"Chocobo Stables cost 10000 gil..."
     Rent it - ChocoBill responds with "Thank you."
     Don't need it - No response.
"My grandson takes care of the Chocobos. He's in the Chocobo Stable at the far
     right of the farm. Please tell him what you want.

Tell me something else
----------------------

ChocoBill: "Someone once told me there is a 'Chocobo Sage' ... somewhere.
"He seems to know how to raise some great Chocobos.
"If he really exists, I'd like to meet him someday."

How do you raise them?
----------------------

ChocoBill: "Chocobos aren't hard to take care of.
"The day to day care will all be done here.
"But, please buy the food for the Chocobo and feed them yourselves.
"Chocobo's abilities will differ with what you feed it, so feel free to choose
     your own food.
"Also, if you're able to find a male and a female Chocobo that like each other,
     they'll produce an egg. But only if you feed them a 'Nut'.
"New Chocobos inherit the abilities of their parents.
"I've heard that sometimes new breed of Chocobo are born with special abili-
     ties. I've never actually seen it, though."

----------
ChocoBilly
----------

ChocoBilly is ChocoBill's Grandson. He stays in the ChocoStables with Chole.

ChocoBilly will teach you how to catch a Chocobo in order to help you cross the
Midgar Swamp to avoid fighting the Midgar Zolom. ChocoBilly sells you a Chocobo
Lure Materia for 2000 gil (disc one only). That may seem like a lot early in
the game, but it's probably well worth it.

ChocoBilly also has an assortment of Greens to help you catch Chocobos avail-
able for purchase. Please, check out the "ChocoShops," "Stats" and "Catching
a Chocobo" sections for information on which Greens you might want.

On discs two and three, ChocoBilly has the same assortment of Greens available,
and he's also added a few different Nuts to the mix. He will also be able to
provide you the information on catching, keeping and breeding Chocobos.

Here is a list of the information ChocoBilly has available for you (note: once
you have caught a Chocobo, this list changes):

 - Feeding Chocobos
 - Mating Chocobos
 - Chocobo by the fence
 - Riding it around
 - What are "classes"

Feeding Chocobos
----------------

ChocoBilly: "What the Chocobo eats are 'Greens'. The most famous one is the
     'Gizard Greens'
"Chocobos will mature differently depending on which 'Greens' they eat. Certain
     'Greens' will boost their Stamina."
"You'll have to figure out what kinds have what effects for yourselves.
"Oh, and Chocobos are born with certain natural abilities. So no matter how
     much they mature, they can't get more abilities than wha they're born
     with.
"Remember that if a Chocobo's abilities don't increase even though you fed it,
     that means its limit has been reached.
"It's best to let those kinds of Chocobo go or mate them to get a new Chocobo."

Mating Chocobos
---------------

ChocoBilly: "A male and a female Chocobo together can produce an egg.

Chocobo by the fence
--------------------

ChocoBilly: "The Chocobo out there is part of the stock that you caught.
"We can only keep 4 Chocobos here at once. If you get a fifth one, the first
     one will be let go.
"If you don't want that to happen, come back and put it in your stable."

Riding it around
----------------

ChocoBilly: "Yeah, you can ride this one.
"And even if you take it outside, this Chocobo won't run away when you get off
     of it.
"If you want to return it to your 'Chocobo Stable', just ride it onto the Farm.
"Then, you'll be able to feed it again."

What are classes?
-----------------

ChocoBilly: "Chocobo strengths are divided by 'Class'."

-----
Chole
-----

Chole will write down any information that that Chocobo Sage gives you about
Special Chocobos, and she'll also provide a brief synopsis on which Chocobo in
your group has the highest stats. More on Chole in the next section.

If you talk to Chole before gathering information from the Chocobo Sage, she'll
tell you:

Chole: "Welcome I've got something good to tell you."
"The White Chocobo likes it when you scratch behind its ears.
"But id you scratch ir someplace that it doesn't like, it'll get mad, so be
careful"

This is a pretty clear clue toward the Mideel Chocobo discussed a little later.

*******************************************************************************
*                           [g04] The Chocobo Sage                            *
*******************************************************************************

At any time after you have access to the Highwind, you can visit the Chocobo
Sage. A wise person who lives nestled away in the Mountains of the Northern
Continent. The Chocobo Sage's house is only reachable with the Highwind or a
Green, Black or Gold Chocobo. There are a few ways to find his house pretty
easily. 

First, starting at the Chocobo Ranch, fly due north. This is easily done by
landing the Highwind right next to the ranch and re-boarding. When the Highwind
takes off, it'll be facing due north. Then fly north until you reach an island.
At the island, turn ninety degrees to the left (facing as close to due west as
you can) and fly. You should see the Chocobo Sage's house in passing.

The second way I've found that works is again to start at the Chocobo Ranch.
Aim the Highwind directly at (or just a little bit north of) Kalm (push select
and use the large world map to help you) and fly toward the town. If you fly
straight and pass just north of Kalm, you should fly right over the Chocobo
Sage's house.

Finally, a prety easy way to find it is to fly to the Bone Village on the
Norhtern Continent. Land the Highwind to get it pointing due north. Re-board it
and tap left on the directional pad or L1 once or twice to turn just a little
toward the west (you probably only want to change the direction by about five
to ten degrees at most. Fly for just a second or two, and you'll be there.

The Chocobo Sage is an odd fellow. However, he has some information about the
different types of Chocobos and how to get them, but he only seems to remember
it in pieces.

After the Chocobo Sage tells you everything he knows, he'll pause and make men-
tion that he can't remember anything else at that time. Some time will have to
pass before he can remember anything, and time (as we should know by now) in
this game is determined by random battles.

I've not been able to dig up the exact mechanics behind the amount of battles
required, but in my testing, it appears that the number of battles fought has
always been between three and six. This leads me to believe it either uses the
same numbers as breeding parent Chocobos (between three and ten), or it uses a
different set of numbers altogether (potentially using three and six as its
limits). Whatever the case, it appears "random", and it appears the information
you're about to receive has no bearing on how many battles. Again, I have no
mechanics to back any of this; this is merely play-testing and speculation.

When you first find the Chocobo Sage, you'll notice he is on the top floor of
his house, and there is a Green Chocobo is a stable on the bottom floor. If you
approach the Chocobo and "inspect" it, it'll provide you with one of the game's
four Enemy Skill Materias.

Going up stairs, speak to the Chocobo Sage. He's the floating blue guy with a
hat on. He'll seem surprized. Then there is some dialouge, and eventually he'll
begin telling you about the different Chocobos. Once he does, you can travel to
the Chocobo Ranch where Chole will "take notes" on what the Chocobo Sage tells
you. You can visit Chole any time to give her the information the Chocobo Sage
had told you up to that point.

The following is the word-for-word transcript of everything the Chocobo Sage
tells you and the clues the Chole jots down from that. You do not have to visit
Chole after each visit to the Chocobo Sage. Chole will keep track of all of the
information you get from the Chocobo Sage, and each time you visit Chole, you
will read all of the information you have received to that point. (Note: any
thing inside of these [backets] is my own commentary on the subject and not
actually expressed within the game's script.)

Note (and minor spoiler): If you visit the Chocobo Sage and complete this part
while the party is split up, the dialogue does not change.

[When you first enter the Chocobo Sage's house and speak to him for the first
time]

Chocobo Sage [currently un-named]: "Ho ho. It's unusual for people to come to
such as out of the way place...
"I can't remember how many years it's been since the last person came."
Cloud: "Who are you?"
Chocobo Sage: "Me? I'm ......
"I don't know."
Cloud: "you don't know who you are?"
Chocobo Sage: "Been a while since I gave it any thought...
"Wonder what they used to call me?
"Oh yeah!! They used to call me the 'Chocobo Sage'. That's right!
"Right, that was it, the Chocobo Sage!!" [after this, the Chocobo Sage is named
     in his "speech bubbles"]
Cloud: (no one would forget that)
Chocobo Sage: "Now what can I do for you?"
     Sell me something [every visit from here on out will have this option]
          - this option takes you to the Chocobo Sage's General store
     What about that Chocobo? [this changes to " You remember something" for
          every visit after this]

Chocobo Sage: "That Chocobo? Well that one is...
"Let's see now. I don't quite remember..."

[Note: at this time, the Chocobo Sage will not remember anything else until
some time has passed, which means random battles.]

[After some battles]

Chocobo Sage: "I remember now! That's the one they call...
"It's a Mountain Chocobo. And just like the name says, he can cross any
     mountain.
"There was another one that could cross rivers, too. They called him 'River
     Chocobo'."
Cloud: "Where can we catch one?"
Chocobo Sage: "There aren't any around now.
Cloud: "...... That's one right there, isn't it?"
Chocobo Sage: "Wha? I wonder what he's doing there?
"I can't remember for the life of me.

[At this time you can re-visit the Chocobo Ranch and talk to Chole about what
you have discovered.]

Chole: "Hey, do you know what a Chocobo Sage is?
"What!? You've actually met him!?
"Wow! What did he tell you?"

[Cloud will move his hands a few times as to show him telling Chole what he had
heard. Cloud will do this every time he comes back from the Chocobo Sage's
House with new information. Chole will in turn respond with...]

Chole: "Wow, that's amazing! ... let me take some notes."

[Then checking back with Chole after giving her the information, she will say]

Chole: "What?"

[and give you the option of "Chole's Chocobo Inspection" or "Let me jot this
down". At this time Chole will go over the information that the Chocobo Sage
has provided in a little more understandable form.]

Chole: Other than the regualr Chocobo, there are "Mountain Chocobo" and "River
     Chocobo.

[Fight some battles and head back to the Chocobo Sage's House.]

Chocobo Sage: "Oh, oh yeah! That Chocobo was...
"Was bred from a 'Great Chocobo' and a 'Good Chocobo'.
"When they're given 'Carob Nuts' while breeding there's a chance you'll get one
     of these Chocobos."
Cloud: "So where's this Chocobo?"
Cloud: "So where can I get these 'Carob Nuts'?"
Chocobo Sage: "Huh? Where? Where was that?
"And what was that nut?
"Can't remember for the life of me..."

[Return to the Chocobo Ranch]

Chole: In order for the "Mountain Chocobo" and "River Chocobo" to be born, you
     must feed the "Carob Nut" to a "Great Chocobo" or a "Good Chocobo" and
     have it produce an egg. But we don't sell any "Carob Nuts".

[Fight battles]

Chocobo Sage: "Oh, OK. I remember! That Chocobo...
"it's on an island southeast of here in a place called Corel surrounded by
     greenery.
"You should be able to catch one just west of Corel And some 'Carob Nuts',
     too......
"There used to be some monsters just south of here that had them. Or you
     might...
"............ Funny ...... What was I saying just now?
"Can't remember for that life of me..."

[Back at the ranch]

Chole: A "Great Chocobo" and a "Good Chocobo" are found... on an island south-
     east of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling at Corel. And in the area west of
     Corel. The "Carob Nut" can be found south of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling.
     Monsters carry them. Let's see, is Bone Village just south of there?

[My assumption is he is talking about the "Good Chocobos" that can be caught
just outside of the Gold Saucer, which is located where Corel once stood and
the "Great Chocobos" that can be caught in the RocketTown area.]

[Fight Battles]

Chocobo Sage: "Oh right!
"It was about the Mountain Chocobo and the River Chocobo I told you about.
"When you mate these two together...
"You get one that can cross rivers AND mountains.
"And... and also... uh, what was I saying?"

[To the ranch!]

Chole: One surprise. If you get the "Mountain Chocobo" and the "River Chocobo"
     to produce an egg, You'll get a Chocobo that can cross mountains and
     rivers. I bet the right nut for that is the "Carob Nut".

[Note: The Carob Nut is not the only nut capable of producing a Black Chocobo.]

[Fight Battles]

Chocobo Sage: "Oh yeah! And also...
"There's one that can cross oceans, too!"
Cloud: "You probably don't remember, but...
"How can I get one of those Chocobos?"
Chocobo Sage: "Hey, don't tease me like that! To get an Ocean-crossing Chocobo,
     you just...
"Let's see now... ... Nope. Don't remember a thing."

[Visit the ranch]

Chole: Bigger surprise: There seems to be a Chocobo that can cross the ocean.
     If you could cross the ocean, mountains and rivers, there'd be no place
     you couldn't go.

[Fight Battles]

Chocobo Sage: "Oh, I remember! The Ocean-crossing Chocobo is...
"The Moutain-and-River-Crossing Chocobo is... is... Oh what was I saying?
"Let's see now... ... Nope. Don't remember a thing."

[At the ranch]

Chole: In order to get a Ocean Chocobo you need to get a Mountain-and-River
     Chocobo to mate with something else.

[Fight Battles]

Chocobo Sage: "Right, right! I remember! You take the Mountain-and-River Cross-
     ing Chocobo...
"Mate it with a 'Wonderful Chocobo' you can catch right around here... And
     you'll get...
"Can't remember for the life of me..."

[At the ranch]

Chole: If you mate the Mountain-and-River Chocobo with a "Wonderful Chocobo", 
     You'll get an Ocean Chocobo. But to do that you can't use an ordinary Nut.

[Fight Battles]

Chocobo Sage: "Oh, right! You'll need a...
"Zeio Nut! Now let me see, as I remember, the Zeio Nut...
"Where was it you could find those things?
"Can't remember for the life of me..."

[At the ranch]

Chole: The "Nut" that produces Ocean Chocobos is the "Zeio Nut". This is the
     first I've ever heard of it. I wonder where you get them?

[Fight Battles]

Chocobo Sage: "Oh yeah! Zeio Nuts were...
"The favorite of goblins. There's a small island east of here where the goblins
     have a bunch of them."
Cloud: "You remember something?"
Chocobo Sage: "Oh!
"That's it..."

[At the ranch]

Chole: Zeio Nuts are found on a little island east of the Chocobo Sage. "Gob-
     lins" have them. WIth this you can produce an "Ocean Chocobo"
Chole: According to my research, Mountain, River and Ocean Chocobos are hard to
     produce, but if you take the right care of the Chocobo, and increase their
     class by winning at the races, it'll increase your chances of getting one.

[Note: "Class" doesn't matter when breeding Chocobos. Only the number of wins
     matters.]

[From this point on, if you ask him if he remembers anything else, he'll
     respond with]

Chocobo Sage: "I think...
"... that's all I'm gonna remember."

Anytime you visit the Chocobo Sage, you'll notice there is a Green Chocobo on
the lower floor on his house behind a gate. If you speak to the Chocobo Sage,
you can ask him for some information on that Chocobo. If you talk to the Choco-
bo, you can also get one of the four Enemy Skill Materia in the game.

*******************************************************************************

Before you head to Mideel for the first time, make sure you have at least one
Mimmett Green in your inventory.

In one of the shops in Mideel, there is a White Chocobo that is racing around
the shop. If you stop the Chocobo, feed it a Mimmett Green and scratch it be-
hind its ear, you'll receive the Contain Materia.

This doesn't have to be done the first time in Mideel. It can be done any time.

*******************************************************************************

This information is also found in the sections describing the different types
of Chocobos, but I thought it would be convenient if it had its own section.

There are four caves in the world that are accessible only with Chocobos. These
caves all hold rare materia that is available no where else.

------------
Quadra Magic
------------

Accessible with: Blue, Black, Gold

Type: Support (Blue)

Located: At the end of a series of island west then north of Mideel. Cave is on
     the northern tip of the last island.

Uses: Allows use of linked Materia four times in one turn. Only used with green
     (magic) Materia or red (summon) Materia (except Knights of the Round).

----
Mime
----

Accessible with: Green, Black , Gold

Type: Command (Yellow)

Located: Eastern side of Wutai Island. Cave is on the east side of a mountain
     by the bridges on its own peninsula.

Uses: Allows the one equipped with it to copy or "Mime" the action of the pre-
     vious party member. Can be used to "Mime" any magic, summon or command.
     Can "Mime" any physical attack of any other character with the exception
     of Limit Breaks. Can only "Mime" a character's own Limit Break (meaning
     no other actions can be preformed after the Limit Break had been used).
     "Miming" a magic or summon cost no additional MP beyond the origianl cast-
     ing.

-------
HP<=>MP
-------

Accessible with: Black, Gold

Type: Independant (Purple)

Located: North of North Corel. Cave is on the south side of a mountain, just
     north of a river.

Uses: Switches the HP and MP of the one equipped. This would allow for a char-
     acter to have up to 9,999 max MP (at the cost of having 999 max HP).

--------------------
Knights of the Round
--------------------

Accessible with: Gold

Type: Summon (Red)

Located: On a lone island in the northeast corner of the World Map. Island has
     a circle of mountains on the outside and is full of forests.

Uses: Summons the Knight of the Round Table to assist you in battle. Summon an-
     imation is about one minute in length as each of the thirteen knights
     takes their turn attacking all of your enemies. This is the most powerful
     non-Limit Break attack in the game, capable of causing close to 130,000 HP
     worth of damage on all foes.

*******************************************************************************

Once you have a Green, Black or Gold Chocobo, you can visit a cave by a water-
fall located straight west of the Gold Saucer (southwest of North Corel). You
may have seen the waterfall while navigating the Tiny Bronco on the river that
cuts the Eastern Continent in half. Just ride your Green, Black or Gold Chocobo
west from the Gold Saucer over the mountains and you'll see a small lake with a
cave on the north side of it. Park your Chocobo on the grassy plain just out-
side of the cave.

To activate a scene with a person in the cave name Lucretia, you must have
Vincent in the active party. You will then learn a little of the story behind
Vincent and Sephiroth and why Vincent feels compelled to help Cloud and Co.

After the short scene, mount your Chocobo and cross the mountains again. Fight
about ten random battles and cross the moutains to the cave again. You'll not
be able to fight any encounters right outside of the cave. After fighting the
battles, go back in the cave with Vincent in your party, and Lucretia will talk
to you again. This time she will give you Vincent's Ultimate Weapon, the "Death
Penalty", and his level four limit manual "Chaos".

Note: This cave is also accessible with a submarine.

*                              [g20] Ruby WEAPON                              *
*******************************************************************************

First, after a story-related event leads you back toward Midgar, you will be
forced to fight Diamond WEAPON. Next, you will have the ability to track down
Ultimate WEAPON. This can be done before or after you re-visit Midgar to con-
tinue the story. I suggest you go to Midgar first because there are some things
in there that will help you beat Ruby WEAPON. Once you have fought, defeated
Ultimate WEAPON and fought one random battle, Ruby WEAPON will poke his head
out of the sand around the Gold Saucer.

Before you begin combat with Ruby, you should have the Ziedrich or Mystile as
your Armor on all active party members and Ribbons as everyone's accessories.
You should also make sure you have a good stock of Megalixirs or Elixirs on
hand.

Ruby Basics
-----------

There are two ways to initiate combat with Ruby WEAPON. You can ram him with
the Highwind, or you can run a Chocobo into him. Either way, you'll want to
make sure you're well prepared for a tough battle. To prepare, you'll want to
enter a random battle and intentionally knock out two of your party members.
This may seem a little odd, but if you don't, Ruby WEAPON will knock two of
your party members out of combat before you can even begin to fight him.

Ruby has two tentacles that he uses to attack you from behind. Until his tent-
acles are in the ground, you will not be able to harm him. Ruby will also use
"Whirlsand" on two random party members before sticking his tentacles in the
ground if they are not knocked out ahead of time. If your party members are
kicked out of battle in this manner, they will not be able to be brought back
until after the fight.

If you damage Ruby's tentacles enough while they are underground, he will pull
them back and use whirlsand if there is more than one party member not KO'd. To
keep Ruby from using "Whirlsand" on your party, KO two party members before the
battle and stay away from attacking the tentacles. Once Ruby has his tentacles
in the ground, cast Life2 on both of your downed party members (Alternatively,
you could summon Phoenix to raise both members of your party, but Ruby absorbs
Fire damage. So, you'd be healing him at the same time).

The Ruby Battle
---------------

Regardless of which tactic you use against Ruby, there are several things that
remain consistant throughout. And, that's Ruby himself.

To start with, Ruby WEAPON has 800,000 HP and 2560 MP. Upon defeating Ruby,
you'll receive 45,000 exp., 50,000 AP and 30,000 gil. Each tentacle has 40,000
HP and 1000 MP, but you receive no exp, AP or gil if you beat them. You will
also receive the "Desert Rose" item for defeating Ruby WEAPON.

Ruby and his tentacles nullify Gravity- and Water-based magics. Ruby's main
body also absorbs Fire-, Ice-, Lightning- and Earth-based magics. So, you see
quite of few of your attack spells will have no effect or even worse will be
counter-effective.

However, there's good news. Ruby and his tentacles are weak against some status
ailments. This can be very helpful. Ruby and his tentacles are weak to Slow,
Paralyze, and Darkness, and his tentacles can be poisoned, though you may not
want to. If his tentacles lose enough HP, Ruby will pull them out of the sand,
and before he puts them back in, he will cast "Whirlsand" on two non-KO'd party
members.

The Strategies
--------------

Note: There are other strategies for defeating Ruby WEAPON than the two I have
listed here. However you do it, he will drop the "Desert Rose". Take the
"Desert Rose" to the "Kalm Traveler", and he'll give you a Gold Chocobo. Not a
bad trade off if you ask me.

(Thanks to Absolute Steve. These stategies are also outlined in his guide.)

Strategy 1
----------

Use status defenses to your advantage

Addiditonal things you should have:

    W-Item Materia
    W-Magic Materia (optional)
    Enenmy Skill Materia (three preferably) with Big Guard
    12 Hero Drinks
    Plenty of Dazers (Could also use Hades or Master Summon Materia)
    Time (not the Materia... actual time. This take a while).

Ruby does not have any elemental weaknesses, but he is weak to Paralyze, which
is usefull as it will stop him completely. It only last for a a few rounds, but
it's still helpful. The best thing you can use here will be Dazers, which you
can steal/morph/win from Boundfat creatures, which appear in the Coral Valley
(after Bone Village). I'd go with stealing. You can also steal Dazers from
Battery Caps, which appear in forests near Nibelheim and Rocket Town. You will
need a lot, or you can just clone them with the W-Item trick (FAQ12). Hades
also inflicts paralyze when cast, but unfortuneateluy not when used with Added
Effect. You can only cast Hades 5 rounds, unless you have Master Summon. Either
way, Dazers are probably prefered since they use no MP and have no limit as to
how many you can use.

Have one character use Dazers with W-item on Ruby and the tentacles at all
times (clone when needed). Have the other two characters use the strongest
attacks they have. If Ruby stays paralyzed he won't be able to attack. You can
also slow ruby so that if it happens he snaps out of paralyze he's alot slower
than normal.

You can poison the tentacles, but it's not recommended. Ruby will withdraw them
from the sand if they take enough damage, and you don't want that. You can also
inflict Darkness on Ruby (and tentacles), but it certainly doesn't help for the
tentacles, and Ruby only has one physical attack that he only uses when the
tentacles aren't in the sand, so it's not worthwhile to waste your time with
that. You should also speed up the party with haste ("Big Guard"), and use Hero
Drinks (4 for each character) to make your attacks (and defense) stronger.

Ruby WEAPON has a very high defense, so it will appear that your attacks are
not as effective as they normally are. Just hang in there. If you continue to
keep Ruby paralyzed and keep hacking away, he'll fall eventually. 

Strategy 2
----------

Minimalizing the effectiveness of Ruby's attacks:

Additional things you should have:

    Elemental Materia (level 3+) linked with Fire in ARMOR
    Three Enemy Skill Materia with "Magic Hammer"
    W-Magic Materia and/or Quadra Magic Materia
    Double Cut Materia (level 2+) on as many party members as possible
    Strong, non-elemental attack spells (Ultima/Comet2)
    Again, time

This again starts based on Ruby having it's tentacles in the sand, and you've
revived your party members that you KO'd before the battle. While his tentacles
are in the sand, Ruby cannot use "Big Claw", "Big Swing", "Whirlsand" or
Comet2. "Ruby Flame" is fire based, so that's free healing for everyone who has
the Level 3+ Elemental-Fire combo in their armor.

That leaves Ultima, "Shadow Flare", the tentacles and "Ruby Ray". Those first
two attacks are rather powerful, but there are ways around them. You can re-
flect "Shadow Flare", but this isn't a good idea to cast that just for that
attack. It's better to prevent Ultima and "Shadow Flare" both from being cast
by having Ruby run out of MP. He has 2560 MP, which is a lot, but if you cast
"Magic Hammer" 26 times, his MP will be gone. So, that is what you'll start by
focusing on. With all three characters doing it, you'll be doing it for about
9-10 turns.

After this, all that's left is the tentacles attacks and "Ruby Ray". The tent-
acles can not kill you, since they only take a certain percentage of your cur-
rent HP away. They also cause bad status effects, but if everyone is equipped
with a Ribbon, this will be prevented. "Ruby Ray" cannot be prevented, but it's
far from being the worst attack in the game. Its base damage is 4662, and it's
only directed at one character. If you have Ziedrich equipped the damage will
even be halved due to a special element.

Now it's all just a matter of healing with Megalixirs (for quickest healing)
and perhaps giving your characters some Hero Drinks to boost attack and de-
fense. For just boosting defense you can also cast "Dragon Force". Attack Ruby
with attacks like 4x Cut if you have high strength. You can also use Ultima or
Comet2 with W-Magic/Quadra Magic. Continue to attack and heal, and eventually,
Ruby WEAPON will fall.

Strategy 3
----------

Using Cheap tricks:

Things you'll need:

     Knights of the Round Materia (or Master Summon)
     HP Absorb Materia
     Mime Materia
     Counter (Command) Materia
     Ziedrich (preferred, not required)
     A little time

This technique is assuming you already have a Gold Chocobo and have received
Knights of the Round. Alternately, you can beat Emerald WEAPON to receive one
copy of each of the Master Materia. It's a fairly simple tactic. It's all about
the setup.

First, link HP Absorb to Knights of the Round. Then link Mime to Counter. Get
into a fight and knock out two of your characters. Enter battle with Ruby
WEAPON. Once Ruby has put his Tenticles into the ground cast Knights of the
Round. Alternately, you can revive the other party members with Life2 or
Phoenix Summon if you want, but it's not necessary. They just won't receive
any experience and/or AP if they're KO'd. If you revive the other characters,
it may help things along to have them also equipped with the Counter=Mime com-
bination.

Once Knights of the Round has been summoned, all you have to do is watch the
fight. Depending on your Magic stat, this will take between ten and twenty
minutes to finish. Every time Ruby WEAPON attacks you, you will counter with
Knights of the Round. Since Knights of the Round is linked to the HP Absorb
Materia, you'll recover enough HP to keep you alive. Ruby WEAPON counters
Knights of the Round with Ultima occasionally, but if you're wearing a decent
armor (Ziedrich), the damage will be minimal. If you're wearing a Mystile,
there's a good chance Ultima will miss. After somewhere between seven and
twelve round, Ruby WEAPON will fall, and you'll receive your Desert Rose.

Again, there are other tactics available. Try some different things, and don't
become too upset about failing this battle. It is an optional battle, and I've
come to the realization that if you stress too much about things in a game,
you're probably taking things too seriously.

*******************************************************************************

I'll try to keep answers here short, sweet and to the point. I want this to be
a quick reference for those wanting to breed Chocobos or those that have a
question about Chocobos in general.

If you have any questions about breeding Chocobos, feel free to send me an
email. I can be reached at gamefaqsuser30@sbcglobal.net. I will do my best to
answer your questions, and if I get the same one enough, I will post it here.

FAQ01: I keep getting a Blue Male, and I need a Blue Female. I've tried reset-
-----       ting. What gives?
Ans:    The RNG needs to be adjusted. If you perform a “hard reset”, the RNG
---         resets to zero, so try something different on the ChocoFarm and try
            again. If you perform a “soft reset”, the RNG maintains its posi-
            tion, so minimal tinkering is required.

FAQ02: When can I start breeding Chocobos?
-----
Ans:    You can start catching them as soon as the Highwind becomes available
---         to you at the start of disc two. Without spoiling much, there is a
            time at the beginning of disc two where the party splits. You will
            be able to start breeding once the entire party gets back together.

FAQ03: How do I get my Chocobos on the Highwind?
-----
Ans:   Ride your Chocobo out of the stables. Approach the Highwind and press
---         the "confirm" button (defaulted to O). Only Chocobos that you have
            moved from the pen to the stables and named can be taken on board.
            When you get off the Highwind, you will be riding your Chocobo. You
            can also visit your Chocobo on the Highwind by going to the bridge
            (default Triangle) and going to the screen that leads to the “Oper-
            ations Room”. This screen looks kind of like an open bay or perhaps
            an Engine room and has Yuffie in it if you’ve taken the time to add
            her to your party. Anyways, follow the arrow that has a Chocobo on
            it (it leads off the right side of the screen) and there’s your
            Chocobo with a handler.

FAQ04: How do I get my Chocobos to the Gold Saucer to race?
-----
Ans:   Fly to North Corel (the town north of the Gold Saucer). Go to the Gold
---         Saucer and inside the Chocobo Square, you'll want to talk to Esther
            (she's to the left of the main counter). She’ll ask you which Cho-
            cobo from the ChocoFarm you want to race with, and she'll register
            you in the next race.

FAQ05: Does it make any difference if I let Tifa/Cid race?
-----
Ans:   No.
---

FAQ06: Is there any difference between the Long Track and the Short Track?
-----
Ans:   The Long Track is longer and has a water area, and the Blue Chocobos
---         don't incur any speed penalty in the water. The Short Track is
            shorter and has a space area. Green Chocobos don't receive any
            speed penalty in the space. Black and Gold Chocobos suffer no pen-
            alty on either course. There is no difference in prizes, and nei-
            ther course effects the outsome of breeding.

FAQ07: I missed the Choco/Mog Summon Materia on my first visit to the Chocobo
-----       Farm. Is there any way of getting it now?
Ans:   Yes. Anytime during the first disc, you can re-visit the Chocobo Farm
---         and speak to the Chocobos in the pen. However, after you've reached
            the second disc, ChocoBilly tells you that all of the people that
            had their Chocobos in the pens decided to take them out. To get
            your Choco/Mog Summon Materia, you'll need to put some of your own
            Chocobos in the pens. All you have to do is go catch a couple of
            them, send them back to the pens and talk to them before moving
            them to the stables.

FAQ08: Can I breed a Gold Chocobo without racing?
-----
Ans:   Short Answer - yes. Longer answer - It is possible to breed any type of
---         Chocobo without any racing. Your will just not breed guaranteed a
            Gold Chocobo without racing. Without manipulating the RNG, you will
            probably be resetting and reloading a lot to get the desired re-
            sults.
       Blue/Green Chocobos - The Break Down - Without winning four combined
            races between your two Good/Great Chocobos, the chances of breeding
            a Blue Chocobo are 46/256 and breeding a Green is a 44/256 chance,
            which will give you a 166/256 chance of getting another Yellow (the
            Yellow will have a 50/50 shot at having each parents rating). If
            you use one Good or Great and one Chocobo rated something else, he
            above chances are reduced to about 11/256 each Blue/Green and
            245/256 Yellow (You must pick the Good/Great first for this to
            work). This is all assuming you're using a Carob Nut, which is re-
            quired to breed a Green or Blue Chocobo.
       Black Chocobos - The Break Down - Without winning nine combined races
            between your Blue and Green Chocobos, the chances of breeding a
            Black Chocobo are reduced to a 10/256 chance. If you don't get a
            Black, the chance of getting a Blue Chocobo is 128/256 and the
            chance of getting a Green is 118/256 chance. Again, this is assum-
            ing you're using a Carob Nut to mate. Without a Carob Nut, you can
            breed a Black Chocobo using any Nut other than a Zeio. Using a
            Pepio or Luchile Nut will give you a 25% chance of breeding a
            Black. Using a Saraha, Lasan, Pram or Porov Nut provides a 50%
            chance of breeding a Black. These chances do not increase with any
            racing.
       Gold Chocobos - The Break Down - Without winning twelve combined races
            between your Black and Wonderful Chocobos, the chances of breeding
            a Gold Chocobo are reduced to 1/32. This is assuming you're mating
            with a Zeio Nut. You cannot breed a Gold Chocobo with any other
            Nut.

FAQ09: Can I breed a Green/Blue Chocobo using a Wonderful?
-----
Ans:   Short answer - yes. Longer answer - It is possible to breed a Green/Blue
---         Chocobo using a Wonderful Chocobo. When you breed using a Wonder-
            ful, you must select the good/great first, and your chances of
            breeding a special Chocobo are reduced by 75% (meaning you only
            have a 25% chance of breeding a Blue/Green Chocobo). The rest of
            the mechanics remain the same. It is impossible to breed a Blue or
            Green using two Wonderful Chocobos.

FAQ10: Can I/How do I make a Wonderful Gold Chocobo?
-----
Ans:   Gold Chocobos that you get when you breed through standard breeding and
---         the Gold Chocobo you receive from the Kalm Traveler for the Desert
            Rose are always going to be rated as Great Chocobos. However, you
            can get a Wonderful Gold Chocobo. When you breed any two Chocobos
            and do not use any of the special breeding mechanics (i.e. don’t
            use a Carob Nut), there is a 50 percent chance of the offspring
            taking one of each parent’s color and a 50 percent chance of the
            offspring taking one of each parent’s rating. That being said, If
            you breed any Wonderful Chocobo with any Gold Chocobo, there is a
            25% chance of getting a Wonderful Gold Chocobo. However, how would
            you check if a Gold Chocobo is Wonderful?

       It’s a good thing you asked.

FAQ11: How can I tell if my Gold Chocobo is a Wonderful Gold Chocobo?
-----
Ans:   Since the only time that you’re specifically told what rating your Cho-
---         cobo has is when you’re moving it from the pen to the stables, you
            will have to use a little deductive reasoning to figure out if a
            Gold Chocobo is a Wonderful or just a standard Great. First thing
            you’ll want to do is breed a Gold. Then breed that Gold with the
            Wonderful that you had to get the Gold using anything but a Carob
            Nut. As previously stated, there is a 25% chance of getting a Won-
            derful Gold Chocobo from this mating. If you get a Yellow Chocobo,
            throw it out and try again, it’s not what we’re looking for. If you
            get a Gold Chocobo, make sure you have a Good/Great with four wins
            (or win four races with your newborn Gold) and mate them using a
            Carob Nut. If you get a Blue/Green Chocobo, you still have a Great
            Gold Chocobo. If your breeding results in a Yellow or a Gold, the
            parent Gold Chocobo is a Wonderful Gold Chocobo. This is true be-
            cause breeding two Good/Great Chocobos (remembering a Gold is Great
            by normal breeding) with four combined wins bred with a Carob Nut
            WILL RESULT in a Blue/Green. If you don’t get a Blue/Green Chocobo,
            the special breeding conditions were not met, and you will get a
            Chocobo of one of the parent’s color. Interesting stuff, right?

By the way, Wonderful Gold Chocobos do not act any different than any other
Gold Chocobos, and they provide no added bonus for racing. It only effects the
breeding mechanics

FAQ12: How do I use the W-Item trick/glitch to get more greens?
-----
Ans:   Fine. If you want to cheat to get your greens, I guess I won’t stop you.
---         ;) First, you need the W-Item materia. You get this during a story-
            related event toward the end of the second disc. The W-Item materia
            enables the one equipped with it to use two items in one round of
            combat. Once you have that, I would recommend going to an area with
            enemies that won’t do much damage if left unguarded for a while. I
            suggest the areas outside of Midgar and Kalm. Equip the W-Item mat-
            eria on any of you active party members and enter a battle. Once in
            battle, have whichever character is equipped with the W-Item mater-
            ia use the command. Select (default O) the item you want to dupli-
            cate and any character in your party or any enemy to use it on.
            Then select any other item (again, O), BUT DO NOT SELECT A CHAR-
            ACTER OR ENEMY TO USE IT ON. Instead, cancel the item selection
            (default X). You’ll notice the inventory of the first item you sel-
            ected has increased by one. Select the second item again and cancel
            before you use it. Again the inventory will show an increase of one
            of the first item selected. Repeat as necessary/wanted. You can
            gain 99 of any battle-usable item in your inventory within a couple
            of minutes. For the purposes of this guide, that gaining a basic-
            ally infinite amount of Sylkis Greens without spending 5,000 gil
            for each one.

*                            [g31] Myths Dispelled                            *
*******************************************************************************

There are a number of myths that surround Chocobos in Final Fantasy VII. This
section will address some of those myths.

Myth:  You need to have "S-Class" Chocobos to breed Special Chocobos.
Truth: No, you don't. As discussed several times throughout this guide, it is
            very possible to breed Special Chocobos without "S-Class" parents.

Myth:  Racing Chocobos increases your odds of breeding Speical Chocobos.
Truth: Kind of true. Having a certain number of combined wins when breeding
            guarantees that you will get certain Special Chocobos when the
            other checks pass (number of wins + rating of Chocobo + Nut, etc.),
            however if you're trying to breed a Gold Chocobo using a Black and
            a Wonderful, you won't have a better chance of breeding a Gold when
            the Black and Wonderful have a combined 10 wins over 2 wins. It's
            kind of an "all-or-nothing"-type thing.

Myth:  "The RNG doesn't like me."
Truth: Again, kind of true. RNG's are designed that under normal circumstances,
            they will produce "random" results. Generally meaning that if you
            are not trying to blindly manipulate the RNG, you will eventually
            receive different results. However, if you're trying to manipulate
            the RNG without any knowledge of how it works, it'll appear to hate
            you.

Myth:  There is a White Chocobo.
Truth: This one is actually true. There is one White Chocobo in Mideel. Scratch
            it behind the ears and feed it a Mimmet Green, and you'll receive
            the Contain Materia.

Myth:  You can catch/breed/ride a White Chocobo.
Truth: No, you can't

Myth:  You can catch/breed/ride/find a Red/Purple/Orange/etc Chocobo.
Truth: As fun as all of these may sound. All of them, in all honesty, are very
            false.

Myth:  There is a Chocobo that can fly/go into space.
Truth: Not in this Final Fantasy.

Myth:  I bred/caught a Chocobo with 190 speed and 1200 Stamina.
Truth: No, you didn't. This usually starts on the message boards in topics re-
            lating to "perfect" Chocobos. There are many users who inevitibly
            will post in the topic that they had bred a Gold Chocobo with 190+
            speed and/or 1200+ Stamina. According to the mechanics of Chocobos,
            it is completely impossible to have a Chocobo with those stats in
            your lineup. These people also often say either "it was my friend's
            game, so I don't have access to the save file" or "I erased that
            file". Either way, they cannot back up their claim of these impos-
            sible Chocobos. Remember that Speed is shown as Dash/34, and the
            Maximum Dash you can have is 6000 (6000/34=176.471 - shown as 176).
            And Stamina(racing) is shown as Stamina(stat)/10. Maximum Stamina
            (stat) is 9999, and 9999/10 is 999.9 (shown as 999). So, your
            highest Chocobo racing stats can be 176 Speed and 999 Stamina.
            What most likely happened was they bred a Gold with 170+ Speed and
            999 Stamina, and they got into a race against TEIOH, whose stats
            are always based on your stats. TEIOH Speed = your speed + 10%,
            and TEIOH Stamina = your stamina + 25%. Meaning a maxed out Gold
            Chocobo (6000 Dash and 9999 Stamina) will give TEIOH 6600 Dash (194
            Speed) and 12,498 Stamina(stat) (1249 Stamina(racing)).

I will keep my eyes open across the Internet for other Myths that exist.

I have not put everything Chocobo-related in this guide... yet. I have tried to 
complile as much information as I can find on Chocobos. I've also tried to add
as much information about anything that could possibly be considered "Chocobo-
related" to the guide. However, there's still more out there, and I'm doing my
best to ensure it's all in here. Now that the guide has been picked up as a
guide for GameFAQs.com, updates have started and will continue coming.

My next goal is to continue the section about the races. If anyone has any
"tricks of the trade" that you would like to share about racing, please feel
free to e-mail them to me.

This section will hopefully also contain more information about each of the
different Chocobos that you can race against as well as some trial and error
results of betting on the races. This will be a time-intensive task, so please,
bear with me.

I've noticed that I need to double check the facts in the Yellow Chocobo sec-
tion, so I will be going through and doing some play-testing to make sure the
information provided is accurate.

As mentioned, there will hopefully soon be an HTML version of this hosted on a
private site and potentially a mobile version. We'll see.

Future updates will include:

 - More in depth mechanics regarding breeding and/or racing (as I can find it)
 - As much information as I can dig up on Chocobos that you might want to know
 - Any additional questions that might need to be posted in the FAQ section
 - And, of course, I’ll keep fixing my typos. :)

Keep watching and keep finding my errors. :)

Again, I need to thank phiefer3, shadow666, Absolute Steve (cloud VS
sephiroth), diamond weapon, sabin01, KingTrode, BrutalAl and Terence for their
help in this guide. Without all of your help, this guide would be no where near
what it is right now. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, all!

A very special thanks to my wife! You've put up with me while I spend countless
hours doing research for this guide. You've listened to me talk about Chocobos
and Final Fantasy VII again and again - both of which I know you care nothing
about. Thank you, and I love you!

I hope I have answered as many of the questions as you might have as I possibly
can. Thank you all for reading this guide.
