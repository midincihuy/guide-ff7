                          ii) Version History
*******************************************************************************

5/22/2003  Version 1.0 - Added all the skills, what they do, enemies to learn
them from, locations of the enemies and a generic comparison of enemy skills
vs. standard spells.  Also added a recommended order of obtaining.

5/26/2003 Version 1.1 - Added the data charts do verify claims of damage.  
Moved monster locations to the skill information area to save time on the
searching through this guide.  Moved all of the technical stuff to the end of
the guide so people who just want to learn about skills don't have to sift 
through it all.

7/12/2003  Version 1.2 - Very minor changes, added alternate skill uses.

3/11/2004 v1.3 - fixed a few minor details, mostly clarifications.  Greatly 
increased the usefulness of the monster section.

6/20/2004 - version Moogle changed email address... please stop emailing me 
WRONG information about Trine and White Wind. 
 

*******************************************************************************
         iii) Enemy Skill Materia Locations and How do they work
*******************************************************************************

There are four enemy skill materias in the game.  Ideally, you're going to want
at least three of them, one for every active member in your party.  Enemy Skill
matera is a command materia, but is not found on the master command.  The 
materia itself adds no stats, such as MP or magic power, but also does not take
stats away such as strength and HP.  Enemy skill cannot be paired with any
support materia.


#1 - Found on the 67th floor of the Shinra headquarters of Midgar.  It appears
after the boss battle occurs.  The materia will be bouncing just in front of 
the containing device labeled "Sample".

#2 - Found in the intermediate training hall, in Junon.  You may get this on
your first trip to Junon while dressed up as a Shinra soldier.

#3 - Found in the Ancient City in the building where Cloud and company stop
to rest at.  It is slightly hidden behind the uppermost bed.

#4 - Found in Chocobo Sages house, talk to the green chocobo there and it will
drop it.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To learn an enemy skill, an opponent must use the skill on a character who is
equipped with the enemy skill materia.  Once hit, your character will spin a 
circle and you will see "Learned Enemy Skill xxxxxxxx".  Once this is said, you
may use that skill for the remainder of the battle.  Upon winning the battle 
you will be able to use that skill from that particular enemy skill materia[s]
at any time.  Should you run from the battle or be kicked off of it, you will
NOT retain the skill.  You can NOT learn enemy skills in the battle arena and 
you can NOT learn them by having one party member casting them onto another
party member.


*******************************************************************************
                      iv) The Enemy Skills
*******************************************************************************

Listed in order of Stars.  This section will illustrate what each of the twenty
four enemy skills do, the pros and cons to the skill and what enemies can cast
it.  This section will also list the enemies location but if you need a more
specific location refer to section v.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frog Song:

Effect - Turns a single target into a frog and puts them too sleep.
Pros - Frogs do minimal damage and may not cast any spell other than toad. 
Sleeping enemies are sitting ducks.  May also be used to remove toad status 
from party members.
Cons - Only hits one target.  Does not work fully on many enemies.
Mp Cost - 5mp
Can learn from - Touch me [Gongaga area], Toxic frog [Temple of the Ancients], 
and Christopher [Crater]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L4 Suicide:

Effect - Causes critical damage to enemies with level divisible by four.  May
also cause 'mini' status as well.
Pros - Critical damage is a HUGE amount of current hp.  Hits all enemy 
targets.
Cons - Many enemies do not have levels divisible by four.  This skill can NOT
kill an enemy either.
Mp Cost - 10mp
Can learn from - Mu [Chocobo farm area], Trickplay [Icicle area]
Note: Critical damage is defined as [HP * 31 / 32] damage.  Furthermore, this 
spell can be reflected.  When reflected the spell only hits one target per 
reflect.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Hammer:

Effect - Takes up to 100mp from an opponent and gives it to the caster.
Pros - Good way to replenish 97mp per casting.  Can drain enemies of MP 
completely so they have do not have any to cast with.
Cons - This skill can be reflected thus you drain mana from yourself causing
a net loss of 3mp.  Somewhat timely if being used to remove enemy MPs.
Mp Cost - 3mp
Can learn from - Razor Weed [Wutai Area]
Note: If the enemy has less than 100mp remaining, you will still knock that 
enemy down 100mp however, you will only gain as much mp as it actually had.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

White Wind:

Effect - Heals all allies (or enemies) by the amount of current hp the 
caster has.  Also cures the following status changes: sleep, poison, confusion,
silence, slow, stop, frog, mini, slow-numb, petrify, berserk, paralyzed, and
darkness, death force and Shield.  If shield status is removed, no other 
status will be removed in that casting.
Pros - This is a healing spell with the built in property of 'all' saving you 
a materia slot.  If you have a lot of life, you can heal your party far cheaper
this way than with the standard cure spells, besides, it changes a large amount
of status changes.
Cons - When you first get White Wind, you may not have enough HP to make it 
worth casting.  Also changes a lot of unlisted good status such as temporary 
death immune [death force] back to normal.
Mp Cost - 34mp
Can learn from - Zemzelett [Junon area].  Wind Wing [Whirlwind Maze]*

* = To learn from Wind Wing you must confuse the wind wing.  White Wind is not
a learnable skill from the manipulate menu.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big Guard:

Effect - Casts Barrier, Magic Barrier and Haste on all allies (or enemies)
Pros - Is a big mana saver from casting them all individually.  Also has a 
built in 'all' saving you many materia slots as well.  You will take half 
damage from physical and magical attacks while getting more turns.
Cons - The Barrier and Magic Barrier drain faster than they would if you
were not in Haste mode*
*A bug exists.  If you are immune to Slow and Stop, you will also be made 
immune to haste, thus the barriers will not drain at double speed
Mp Cost - 56mp
Can learn from - Beach plug [Costa del sol beaches]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Angel Whisper:

Effect - Fully revives one dead ally, heals an injured ally to full.  Angel
whisper also cures the following status changes: KO, Sleep, poison, confusion,
silence, slow, stop, frog, mini, petrify, berserk, darkness and paralyzed.
Pros - This is life2/full cure/semi-Esuna on the same spell, and fairly cheap 
to cast too.
Cons - Only hits one target
Mp Cost - 50mp
Can learn from - Pollensalta [Crater]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dragon Force:

Effect - Raises Defense and Magic Defense*
Pros - You take less damage
Cons - Somewhat expensive, targets only one target and seems to be
ineffective.
Mp Cost - 19mp
Can learn from - Dark Dragon [Crater]
*Final Fantasy VII has a Magic defense bug.  Your magic defense will NOT in 
fact increase in the game because of the bug.  In fact, no magic defense works.
The only way to increase your resistance to magic is by raising the 'spirit'
stat.  Dragon Force will still increase the base spirit stat but the MDef armor
stat will not be included, though its multiplier will be.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Death Force:

Effect - Target becomes immune to death
Pros - Protects against sudden death.  Will not remove a countdown, but if 
still active when the timer hits zero, will protect from the dying.
Cons - Only hits on target, very limited use.  Easily removed by many friendly
spells.
Mp Cost - 3mp
Can learn from - Adamantaimai [Wutai Area]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flame Thrower:

Effect - Projects a stream of flame at one target
Pros - A source of fire damage which hits one target.  
Cons - very weak damage, possibly the most useless of all enemy skills.  It is
also reflectable, this benefits you in no way though since it's a single target
spell, thus, you can reflect it only once per casting.
Mp Cost - 10mp
Can learn from - Ark Dragon [Mithril Mines], Dragon [Mount Nibel]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Laser:

Effect - A gravity based attack which takes one half of a single 
targets current hp away.
Pros - Cheaper than demi2 and has the same effect.
Cons - Only hits one target, most bosses are immune to gravity attacks.  Laser
is also reflectable, this benefits you in no way though since it's a single 
target spell, thus, you can reflect it only once per casting.
Mp Cost - 16
Can learn from - Death Claw [Desert Prison], Dark Dragon [Crater]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Matra Magic:

Effect - Light non-elemental damage to all enemies
Pros - Possibly the best early game spell.  Very cheap, hits all enemies and 
does decent damage.  Furthermore, this spell can be reflected.  When reflected 
the spell only hits one target per reflect.  If your entire party has reflect 
set up, you can hit a total of three targets once or one target three times.  
Cons - Quickly becomes obsolete because of it's low damage.
Mp Cost - 8mp
Can learn from - Custom Sweeper [Midgar area], Bullmotor [Desert Prison], and
Death Machine [Desert Prison]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bad Breath:

Effect - Casts confusion, frog, mini, poison silence, and sleepel on all 
enemies.
Pros - A very large amount of status changes which render many enemies 
defenseless.
Cons - Does not work on most bosses, somewhat expensive
Mp Cost - 58mp
Can learn from - Malboro [Gaea's Cliff, Crater]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beta:

Effect - Extreme fire damage to all opponents
Pros - Massive fire damage spell which can be obtained very early. Hits all 
targets.
Cons - None, unless you cast it on fire absorbing opponents
Mp Cost - 35mp
Can learn from - Midgar Zolom [Chocobo farm area]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aqualung:

Effect - Extreme water damage to all opponents
Pros - Can be obtained very early.  Not many enemies are well defended against 
water.  Excellent spell against bosses.  Furthermore, this spell can be 
reflected.  When reflected the spell only hits one target per reflect.  If 
your entire party has reflect set up, you can hit a total of three targets once
or one target three times.  Very effective against bosses.
Cons - None, unless you cast it on the very rare water absorbing opponents.
Mp Cost - 34mp
Can learn from - Harpy [Corel area*], Jenova Life [City of the Ancients], and 
Serpent [Gelnika Airplane]

Harpy's are found ON THE SAND outside of the gold sacuer ON THE WORLD MAP, you
may only go on this area and encounter battles in the buggy.  They can also be
encountered with Chocobos on the nearby tracks.  THESE ARE NOT FOUND INSIDE OF
THE DESERT PRISON.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trine*:

Effect - Strong lightning damage to all opponents
Pros - Very cheap, hits all targets, good damage
Cons - Not as strong as Beta or Aqualung, bad choice against lightning 
absorbing opponents.
Mp Cost - 20mp
Can learn from - Materia Keeper [Mount Nibel], Godo [Wutai], and Stilva [Gaea's
cliff]
*Note: Trine is ONLY taught by these three enemies and they are all one time 
only.  The Materia Keeper you MUST fight before getting the second and third 
copies of Enemy skill materia.  Stilva's MUST be fought before getting the 
fourth copy of Enemy skill materia.  This means Godo is your ONLY source of 
Trine after you get the Highwind and the fourth enemy skill materia.  If you 
kill him before this you do so AT YOUR OWN LOSS.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Breath:

Effect - Extreme fire/lightning/ice damage to all opponents
Pros - Possibly the most powerful all enemy hitting elemental attack in the 
entire game.
Cons - If an enemy is able to absorb any one of the elements, that enemy will 
absorb all of the damage.  If any one element is nullified the damage to the 
enemy will be zero.
Mp Cost - 75mp
Can learn from - Stilva [Gaea's Cliff], Parasite [Crater]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

????:

Effect - Does non elemental damage.  Casters [max hp - current hp] = damage  
Pros - Good damage if you frequently have 1/9999 hp
Cons - not enough damage if you don't have high max hp and
Mp Cost - 3mp
Can learn from - Jersey [Shinra Mansion], Behemoth [Midgar]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Goblin Punch:

Effect - Physical damage to one target based on magical attack.  The damage is
greater as your level is nearer to an enemy level.
Pros - If you don't want to waste a limit break, this is a good way to do 
decent damage for no cost.
Cons - Is weak against enemies, especially in the late game as few monsters are
above level fifty.
Mp Cost - 0mp
Can learn from - Goblin [Goblin Island]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chocobuckle:

Effect - Non-elemental damage to a single target.  Damage is equal too the 
number of battles you have run from.
Pros - In theory you can do 9,999 damage with this skill.  However, better
uses are getting it to 1,111 or 2,222 damage to inflict easy Lucky 7's on your
party.
Cons - Takes a VERY long time to power up, somewhat of a pain to learn too.
Mp Cost - 3mp
Can learn from - Chocobos [Chocobo Tracks]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

L5 Death:

Effect - Casts instant death on any target with a level divisible by 5.  
Pros - Targets all enemies, quickly kills them if able
Cons - Does not effect most enemies, does not effect enemies immune to death.
Mp Cost - 22mp
Can learn from - Parasite [Crater]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Death Sentence:

Effect - Creates a sixty second timer above one targets head.  When the timer
reaches zero Instant death will be cast.
Pros - None

enemies will still be immune to the death effect.
Mp Cost - 10mp
Can learn from - Gi Spector [Cave of Gi] , Sneaky Step [Cave of Gi], and 
Boundfat [Bone village area]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Roulette:

Effect - Selects a random target from ALL targets on the battle screen and
casts death on that target
Pros - It is somewhat amusing to watch, though it's pretty useless.  
Cons - You can kill yourself!
Mp Cost - 6mp
Can learn from - Death Dealer [Crater]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shadow Flare:

Effect - Extreme non-elemental damage to a single target
Pros - The damage is huge, more powerful than flare.
Cons - Hits only one target, quite expensive to cast.  Shadow flare is also 
reflectable, this benefits you in no way though since it's a single target 
spell, thus, you can reflect it only once per casting.
Mp Cost - 100mp
Can learn from - Dragon Zombie [Crater], Ultimate Weapon [Cosmo Canyon]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pandora's Box*:

Effect - Heavy magical damage to all enemies.  This attack is piercing, 
meaning it ignores defense.
Pros - Hits all targets, does large damage.  Furthermore, this spell can be 
reflected.  When reflected the spell only hits one target per reflect.  If 
your entire party has reflect set up, you can hit a total of three targets once
or one target three times.  Very effective against bosses.
Cons - Very expensive.
Mp Cost - 120mp
Can learn from - Dragon Zombie [Crater]
*=This is a one time learn skill, make sure you have ALL of your enemy skill
materias on.  When the first Dragon Zombie you kill dies, it will cast this.
Once cast, it will set the variable to be disabled so the attack can never be
repeated.

-Note: Some people have seen it happen twice in a game, even in a battle, the
only explanations I can offer are: 1) The changing of the variable somehow 
failed due to faulty memory blocks.  2) There is another global variable which
is presently unknown which is able to reset it.  I lean to explanation one.
Plan on only seeing this attack ONCE.

* Feed the chocobo a mimett greens [or skylis] and hit it more than 31/32's of 
its max hp but don't kill it.  Since this is not likely going to happen with 
most forms of damage there is a much easier way.  Be sure the chocobo has a 
level divisible by four.  All chocobos around Mideel are divisible by four and 
so are some by the chocobo farm.  Then, after giving it the green, hit it with 
L4 suicide.

Notes: Dragon Zombies are very rare to encounter, they are in the right path
of the crater.  Pandora's Box will be used as a finishing move if you kill it 
normally.  Dragon Zombies are vulnerable to healing spells though highly
resistant to normal magic.  Using white wind will often petrify them making it
impossible for them to cast Pandora's Box

*=This is a one time learn skill, make sure you have ALL of your enemy skill
materias on.  When the first Dragon Zombie you kill dies, it will cast this.
Once cast, it will set the variable to be disabled so the attack can never be

walk on this area and get in battles with the buggy.  They also appear with
Chocobos on the nearby tracks.

a lot of damage this early.

Notes: They use bad breath very rarely, unlike future Final Fantasy games which
is the only attack they seem to use.  Anyway, frozen beam is their main attack.
As the name suggests, it's an ice attack which does considerable damage.  Be 
careful if you're getting this skill on Gaea's Cliff.

Notes: In theory this can be the fourth enemy skill you'll get.  However, the 
Zolom packs quite a punch and you're going to find it difficult.  Elemental and
fire paired together in the armor will cut Betas damage in half.  To about 650
at very low levels.  However, since it's almost always followed up by a bite
attack you're going to want to have around 900 hp just to be safe.  If you are
unable to get it right away, just do it when you come back later.

Location - All over the world, skill gotten Near Cosmo Canyon
Learnable Skill - Shadow Flare
Notes: He will only use Shadowflare in the final encounter near Cosmo canyon.
Shadowflare is his final attack, this it will only target the member who killed
him.  To ensure you get it on every enemy skill materia, stack all of them on
the same character and make sure that character is the only one attacking 
Ultimate Weapon in this battle.  If you wish to get the AP for the battle as 
well, equip a touph ring, as many hp pluses as you can and have an Mbarrier up.
Hopefully, with all of this up his Shadowflare will only do around 4,100 damage
to you and you'll be able to make good use of his 3,500ap as well as getting
three copies of shadow flare.

*******************************************************************************
                     vi) Comparison with other materia
*******************************************************************************

This section compares the effectiveness of several enemy skills to similar 
spells which are usable from other materia.  Currently aside from mp cost

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frog Song:

Similar Spells - Toad, Sleepel
Cost of other spells - 14, 8
Final choice - Frog song is far cheaper and is available at about the same
point in the game.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

White Wind:

Similar Spells - Cure1, Cure2, Cure3, Full cure
Cost of other spells - 5, 24, 64, 99
Final choice - varies, if you have a lot of current hp with the caster, White
wind is a far more effective spell than any of the cures.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big Guard:

Similar Spells - Barrier, MBarrier, Wall, Haste 
Cost of other spells - 16, 24, 58, 18
Final choice - Big Guard, far cheaper and much easier to set up than casting 
all of the other spells.  If the haste bothers you, put time-added affect in
your armor and you will be unable to enter haste mode, as well as being slowed
or stopped.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Angel Whisper:

Similar Spells - Life2, Full Cure 
Cost of other spells - 100, 99
Final choice - Angel Whisper is far more effective than full cure and just
as good as life2 for half the price.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flame Thrower:

Similar Spells - Fire, Fire2, Fire3
Cost of other spells - 4, 22, 55
Final choice - Flamethrower does do the most damage per mp point of any fire
skill aside from fire[1].  However, since the damage is quite low you will need
to take several turns to get to the damage of fire3 and such.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Laser:

Similar Spells - Demi2 
Cost of other spells - 33
Final choice - Much cheaper than demi2, however, demi2 can be paired with an
'all' materia to hit many targets or 'Quadra magic' to be cast four times.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bad Breath:

Similar Spells - Hades
Cost of other spells - 150
Final choice - Bad breath is much cheaper, but Hades deals damage as well as a
few additional status effects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beta:

Similar Spells - Fire-all, Fire2-all, Fire3-all, Ifrit [Summon]
Cost of other spells - 4, 22, 55, 34
Final choice - Beta is the best off all of these spells.  Beta does over 125%
the amount of damage of Fire3 for 67.3% of the cost.  Compared to Ifrit which
has roughly the same casting cost, Beta does just over 200% the damage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Aqualung:

Similar Spells - Leviathan [Summon]
Cost of other spells - 78
Final choice - Aqualung is a far better spell.  For only 43.5% the cost of 
Leviathan, Aqualung does almost 68% as much damage.  Making it far more cost 
effective.  Add into that the animation is shorter and it can be reflected and
you have yourself an all purpose spell.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Trine:

Similar Spells - Lightning-all, Lightning2-all, Lightning3-all, Ramuh
Cost of other spells - 5, 22, 55, 40
Final choice - I would be lying if I said trine isn't one of the best spells in
the entire game.  For only 38.5% the cost of Bolt3, Trine does 80% the amount 
of damage.  Ramuh, the lightning summon, costs twice as much as trine and does
only 88.5% of trines damage.  Trine has one of the best dmg/mp ratios of any
spell in the game.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Magic Breath:

Similar Spells - Kjata [Summon]
Cost of other spells - 110, 160
Final choice - Magic Breath costs about 68% of Kjata and does almost 78% as 
much damage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pandora's Box: 

Similar Spells - Ultima, Bahamut [Summon], Neo Bahamut [Summon], Bahamut 
Zero [Summon] Knights of the Round [Summon]
Cost of other spells - 130, 100, 140, 180, 250
Note: They are only similar in the effect that they all do huge damage to all
targets.  All of these spells [except Ultima] ignore defense [in this case 
magic defense [called piercing]] to ensure large damage.  
Final choice -  Pandora's Box is 110% more expensive than Bahamut, 79% as 
expensive as Neo Bahamut, 61% as expensive as Bahamut Zero, and 85% as costly
as Ultima.  It does about 93% the damage of Bahamut, 50% the damage of 
Bahamut Zero and only 65% as much damage as Ultima, making it a highly 
expensive skill with no real advantage over any of the other spells.


*******************************************************************************
                      vii) Comparing to each other
*******************************************************************************

So, after seeing above how enemy skills are in general far more cost friendly, 
why not take the time to answer the next question I'm begging.  Which enemy 
skill should I run around casting in random battles?  

Of course, the answer does vary depending on the immunities a monster has.  
But, for the purpose of demonstration, I tested all enemy skills which do 
variable damage against monsters.  While I could have just checked game code, 
there are many bugs which could throw such a thing off.  For anyone who cares,
the testing was done on the enemy 'Head Hunter' found near Mideel.  This enemy
was selected for several reasons.  First, and most importantly, they appear 
close to 75% of the battles in the forests around Mideel.  Secondly, they 
appear in groups of three or four, giving me many targets to hit.  Another 
important reason was the lack of immunity to any element I was testing.  They
suffered no double damage either, making this a fast process.  Each spell was
tested 100 times and averaged out.  I will include 20 random picks from the
testing in this FAQ to demonstrate what occurred.  

Note: All testing was done by Vincent, who had 255 magic attack at level 71.  
I did NOT factor in the magic defense of the head hunter since I was also 
comparing damages of many spells which pierce magic defense, which would be an
unfair comparison.  Note, in order to get the 'real' damage of some spells I
was forced to use a magic barrier on them, and then doubled the answer.  This
could cause a VERY small inaccuracy as 5500 doubled could be 10999, 11000, or
11001 damage.  However, a total of one hundred possible damage from one 
hundred testings is a rather small number compared to the 1,300,000+ damage
which was done.

Now, we see that Shadow flare obviously does the most damage per target.  But,
since it only hits one target it's not such a bargain.  In the next set of 
tables we will go about analyzing the spells more; in hopes of showing which
ones are really worth it under what circumstances.

This first table is a comparison of how expensive the enemy skills are in 
relation to one another.  There is a line with each skill's cost being set as 
100% the cost and showing  others costs around it.

This next table will compare the average damage done to a target of one spell
to the average damage of the same target with a different spell.  After doing
this, they will be compared by how much damage they do to a single target in 
relation to how much damage they do to that target.  Since this obviously 
benefits skills which hit only one target, they will then be compared by how
much total damage they do to a full screen of targets, five, in one casting. 
Since this will obviously dis-favor skills which only hit one target I decided
to compare and ultimately rank them in both ways.

                         viii) Other Notes
*******************************************************************************

About a third of all enemy skills are able to be reflected.  The following ones
can be reflected;

L4 Suicide - 1 target per reflect
Magic Hammer
Flame Thrower
Laser
Matra Magic - 1 target per reflect
Aqualung - 1 target per reflect
Shadow Flare
Pandora's Box - 1 target per reflect

Be weary of these and use them to your advantage whenever possible.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

White Wind has a hidden status attack when used as an offensive spell against
the unholy/undead.  It will frequently petrify them.  Angel Whisper can also
be used offensively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frog Song can both inflict and cure Toad and sleep statuses

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Big Guard can be used to clear the statuses of Slow and Stop since it casts
haste, however, if you defend slow and stop big guard will not be able to grant
you haste at all.


*******************************************************************************
                      ix) Order of Obtaining
*******************************************************************************

Depending on how many enemy skills materias you wish to complete will depend
on the order you get the skills.  Some skills, such as trine, are only 
available in areas which can not be accessed over and over.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using only one enemy skill materia you will get them in this order.

1. Matra Magic [Custom Sweeper]
2. L4 Suicide [Mu]
3. Chocobuckle [Chocobo]
4. Beta [Midgar Zolom]*
5. Flamethrower [Ark Dragon]
6. Laser [Death Claw]
7. Big Guard [Beach Plug]
8. Aqualung [Harpy]
9. White Wind [Zemzelett]
10. Frog Song [Touch Me]
11. Death Sentence [Gi Spector]
12. ???? [Jersey]
13. Trine [Materia Keeper]
14. Death Force [Adamantaimai]
15. Magic Hammer [Razor Weed]
16. Magic Breath [Stilva]
17. Bad Breath [Malboro]
18. Goblin Punch [Goblin]
19. Shadowflare [Ultimate Weapon]
20. Dragon Force [Dark Dragon]
21. L5 Death [Parasite]
22. Roulette [Death Dealer]
23. Angel Whisper [Pollensalta]
24. Pandora's Box [Dragon Zombie]
*the Midgar Zolom will likely be too powerful at this point in the game, come
back for beta when you backtrack to pick up White wind from Zemzelett.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using the first two enemy skill materias, the most efficient ways
to get the skills you will have missed are;

1. Matra Magic [Bullmotor]
2. L4 Suicide [Mu* or Trickplay]
3. Chocobuckle [Chocobo]
4. Flamethrower [Dragon or Arc Dragon*]
5. Beta [Midgar Zolom]*
*Since you will likely be backtracking to get Beta on the first enemy skill as
well, it's just as easy to pick up all of these skills from the weaker enemies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using the first three enemy skill materias, the first skill you will
get on the third on is Aqualung, from Jenova Life.  You will pick up starting 
at Magic Breath.  The best way to learn the first 15 skills are:

1. Matra Magic [Custom Sweeper]
2. L4 Suicide [Trickplay]
3. Chocobuckle [Chocobo]*
4. Beta [Midgar Zolom]
5. Flamethrower [Ark Dragon]
6. Laser [Dark Dragon]
7. Big Guard [Beach Plug]
8. Aqualung [Serpent]
9. White Wind [Zemzelett]
10. Frog Song [Touch Me]
11. Death Sentence [Boundfat]
12. ???? [Behemoth]
13. Trine [Stilva]**
14. Death Force [Adamantaimai]
15. Magic Hammer [Razor Weed]
*Wait until you get the highwind and just do this at Mideel.
**This involves no backtracking at all and you can get it along with Magic
Breath.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you plan to max out all four enemy skill materias, be CERTAIN you do NOT
kill Godo before getting the fourth one.  If you do, your only remaining 
source of the skill, Trine, will be lost.  When you get this materia, the
first copy will [can] have all skills 1-17.  For those skills you will be
able to pick up some of them in the crater, but most of them you'll be forced
to backtrack for.  Remember, and I can not emphasize this enough, Godo is the
ONLY source for Trine for this enemy skill.
